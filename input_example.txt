Abstract
  Importance Pain is a silent global epidemic impacting approximately a third of the population. Pharmacological and surgical interventions are primary modes of treatment. Cognitive/behavioural management approaches and interventional pain management strategies are approaches that have been used to assist with the management of chronic pain. Accurate data collection and reporting treatment outcomes are vital to addressing the challenges faced. In light of this, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the current digital application landscape within chronic pain medicine. Objective The primary objective was to consider the prevalence of digital application usage for chronic pain management. These digital applications included mobile apps, web apps, and chatbots. Data Sources We conducted searches on PubMed and ScienceDirect for studies that were published between 1st January 1990 and 1st January 2021. Study Selection Our review included studies that involved the use of digital applications for chronic pain conditions. There were no restrictions on the country in which the study was conducted. Only studies that were peer-reviewed and published in English were included. Four reviewers had assessed the eligibility of each study against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Out of the 84 studies that were initially identified, 38 were included in the systematic review. Data Extraction and Synthesis The AMSTAR guidelines were used to assess data quality. This assessment was carried out by 3 reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Before data collection began, the primary outcome was to report on the prevalence of digital application usage for chronic pain conditions. We also recorded the type of digital application studied (e.g. mobile application, web application) and, where the data was available, the prevalence of pain intensity, pain inferences, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Results 38 studies were included in the systematic review and 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The digital interventions were categorised to web and mobile applications and chatbots, with pooled prevalence of 0.22 (95% CI -0.16, 0.60), 0.30 (95% CI 0.00, 0.60) and -0.02 (95% CI -0.47, 0.42) respectively. Pooled standard mean differences for symptomatologies of pain intensity, depression, and anxiety symptoms were 0.25 (95% CI 0.03, 0.46), 0.30 (95% CI 0.17, 0.43) and 0.37 (95% CI 0.05, 0.69) respectively. A sub-group analysis was conducted on pain intensity due to the heterogeneity of the results (I2=82.86%; p=0.02). After stratifying by country, we found that digital applications were more likely to be effective in some countries (e.g. USA, China) than others (e.g. Ireland, Norway). Conclusions and Relevance The use of digital applications in improving pain-related symptoms shows promise, but further clinical studies would be needed to develop more robust applications.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Abstract
  Background: A range of psychological issues often accompany breast cancer chemotherapy. Owing to their ubiquity, mobile phones have been used to deliver supportive interventions that address these issues. However, we currently lack sufficient evidence to guide the design of such interventions. Aim(s): To analyse and synthesise available evidence on the effectiveness of mobile-phone-based (mHealth) interventions in alleviating the psychological issues experienced by women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Method(s): A systematic literature search was conducted from 14 relevant databases. Revman 5.4 was used to pool the quantitative results from comparable studies for statistical meta-analysis. For clinically heterogeneous studies where statistical pooling of results was not possible, a narrative summary was used to present the findings. Result(s): The review included ten published studies which covered 1,548 patients. The meta-analysis results indicated a significant improvement in the quality of life (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.07, 0.58], p = .01, I2 = 17%). No significant effects were found for anxiety (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI [-0.26, 0.25], p = 0.96, I2 = 53%) and depression (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.20], p = .87, I2 = 0%). Individual studies suggest reduced symptom prevalence (p = .033, d =.27), symptom distress (p = .004, d = .004), symptom interference (p = .02, d = .51), supportive care needs (p < .05, d = 2.43); improved self-efficacy (p = .03, d = 0.53), self-esteem (p <.001, d = 0.87) and emotional functioning (p = .008, d = .30). The methodological quality ranged from low to moderate. Conclusion(s): mHealth interventions might be helpful in addressing certain psychological issues experienced by this population, although the evidence is still being gathered and not yet conclusive. More rigorous trials are hereby warranted to confirm the suitable duration while addressing the methodological flaws found in previous studiesCopyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Abstract
  Objective The aim of this systematic review is to provide some evidence on the use of mobile phone communication for improving ARV adherence during pregnancy, as well as to investigate whether text messaging on mobile phones could improve follow-up in HIV-exposed infants. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis, using CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Scopus, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL to search for studies in English published between 5 may 2016 to May 2021 that assessed the effects of mobile phone in HIV-infected pregnant women. We used MetaPro version 3.0 to compute the OR and RR and their 95%CI. We performed random-effects model meta-analysis for estimating pooled outcomes. Results Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled maternal postpartum retention was (OR 2.20, 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.13, I2 = 53.20%, P < 0.001). In the same line, the pooled odds of ART uptake was (OR 1.5, 95%CI: 1.07-2.11, I2 =0%, P = 0.020) and we found statistically significant impact of mobile phone on HIV testing at 6 weeks and above among HIV exposed children (OR 1.89, 95%CI: 1.04 - 3. 48, I2 = OR 1.89, 95%CI: 1.04 - 3. 48, I2 =88.04%, P = 0.032). Conclusion In comparison to our previous review, this updated review focuses on moderate evidence for mobile phone communication in HIV-infected pregnant women. The results showed that using a mobile phone improved maternal post-partum retention, ART uptake, and infant HIV testing at 6 weeks and older.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Mobile health (mHealth)/electronic health (eHealth) have the effect of facilitating weight loss in overweight and obese populations. However, studies have shown varied results and relatively high heterogeneity in the efficacy of mHealth/eHealth interventions. The aim of the paper was to systematically summarise published studies about the weight loss efficacy of mHealth/eHealth. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive review of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases published from inception to 21 March 2021 will be conducted. The selected articles are meta-analyses that integrated the studies, which evaluated efficacy of mHealth/eHealth. Two people will select eligible articles and extract data independently. Any disputes will be resolved by discussion or the arbitration of a third person. The methodological quality of the included meta-analyses will be assessed with AMSTAR V.2 and the quality of evidence will be obtained with Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The study selection process will be presented using a flowchart. We will reanalyse each outcome with random effect methods. If possible, we will use funnel plot and Egger's test to evaluate if publication bias existed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for the study, as we collected data only from available published materials. This umbrella review will also be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication after completion.

Abstract
  Background: Smartphone-based interventions are increasingly being used to facilitate positive behavior change, including reducing alcohol consumption. However, less is known about the effects of notifications to support this change, including intervention engagement and adherence. The aim of this review was to assess the role of notifications in smartphone-based interventions designed to support, manage, or reduce alcohol consumption. Method(s): Five electronic databases were searched to identify studies meeting inclusion criteria: (1) studies using a smartphone-based alcohol intervention, (2) the intervention used notifications, and (3) published between 1st January 2007 and 30th April 2021 in English. PROSPERO was searched to identify any completed, ongoing, or planned systematic reviews and meta-analyses of relevance. The reference lists of all included studies were searched. Result(s): Overall, 14 papers were identified, reporting on 10 different interventions. The strength of the evidence regarding the role and utility of notifications in changing behavior toward alcohol of the reviewed interventions was inconclusive. Only one study drew distinct conclusions about the relationships between notifications and app engagement, and notifications and behavior change. Conclusion(s): Although there are many smartphone-based interventions to support alcohol reduction, this review highlights a lack of evidence to support the use of notifications (such as push notifications, alerts, prompts, and nudges) used within smartphone interventions for alcohol management aiming to promote positive behavior change. Included studies were limited due to small sample sizes and insufficient follow-up. Evidence for the benefits of smartphone-based alcohol interventions remains promising, but the efficacy of using notifications, especially personalized notifications, within these interventions remain unproven.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Computerized psychological interventions can overcome logistical and psychosocial barriers to the use of mental health care in the Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense settings. OBJECTIVE(S): In this systematic review, we aim to outline the existing literature, with the goal of describing: the scope and quality of the available literature, intervention characteristics, study methods, study efficacy, and study limitations and potential directions for future research. METHOD(S): Systematic searches of two databases (PsycINFO and PubMed) using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were conducted from inception until November 15, 2020. The following inclusion criteria were used: the study was published in an English language peer-reviewed journal, participants were randomly allocated to a computerized psychological intervention or a control group (non-computerized psychological intervention active treatment or nonactive control group), an intervention in at least one treatment arm was primarily delivered through the computer or internet with or without additional support, participants were veterans or service members, and the study used validated measures to examine the effect of treatment on psychological outcomes. RESULT(S): This review included 23 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Most studies were at a high risk of bias. Targeted outcomes, participant characteristics, type of support delivered, adherence, and participant satisfaction were described. Most of the examined interventions (19/24, 79%) yielded positive results. Study limitations included participant characteristics limiting study inference, high rates of attrition, and an overreliance on self-reported outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Relatively few high-quality studies were identified, and more rigorous investigations are needed. Several recommendations for future research are discussed, including the adoption of methods that minimize attrition, optimize use, and allow for personalization of treatment.Copyright ©Rahel Pearson, Emily Carl, Suzannah K Creech.

Abstract
  Background For more than 20 years, the potential health risks of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF) exposure from mobile communication devices on children and adolescents have been examined because they are considered sensitive population groups; however, it remains unclear whether such exposure poses any particular risk to them. Objectives The aim of this review was to systematically analyze and evaluate the physiological and health-related effects of RF EMF exposures from wireless communication devices (mobile phones, cordless phones, Bluetooth, etc.) on children and adolescents. Methods This review was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Methodological limitations in individual studies were assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk-of-Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies. Results A total of 42 epidemiological and 11 experimental studies were eligible for this review. Most of the studies displayed several methodological weaknesses that limited the internal validity of the results. Due to a lack of consistency regarding the outcomes as well as the lack of scientific rigor in most reviewed studies, the body of evidence for the effects of RF EMF of mobile communication devices on subjective symptoms, cognition, and behavior in children and adolescents was low to inadequate. Evidence from the studies investigating early childhood development, brain activity, cancer, and physiological parameters was considered inadequate for drawing conclusions about possible effects. Discussion Overall, the body of evidence allows no final conclusion on the question whether exposure to RF EMF from mobile communication devices poses a particular risk to children and adolescents. There has been rapid development in technologies generating RF EMF, which are extensively used by children and adolescents. Therefore, we strongly recommend high-quality systematic research on children and adolescents, since they are generally considered as sensitive age groups.Copyright © 2022 Bodewein et al.

Abstract
  Background: The global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) disease has highlighted the importance of disease monitoring, diagnosing, treating, and screening. Technology-based instruments could efficiently assist healthcare systems during pandemics by allowing rapid and widespread transfer of information, real-time tracking of data transfer, and virtualization of meetings and patient visits. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the applications of clinical informatics (CI) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): A comprehensive search was performed on Medline and Scopus databases in September 2020. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The extracted data from the studies reviewed were about study sample, study type, objectives, clinical informatics domain, applied method, sample size, outcomes, findings, and conclusion. The risk of bias was evaluated in the studies using appropriate instruments based on the type of each study. The selected studies were then subjected to thematic synthesis. Result(s): In this review study, 72 out of 2716 retrieved articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text analysis. Most of the articles reviewed were done in China and the United States of America. The majority of the studies were conducted in the following CI domains: prediction models (60%), telehealth (36%), and mobile health (4%). Most of the studies in telehealth domain used synchronous methods, such as online and phone- or video-call consultations. Mobile applications were developed as self-triage, self-scheduling, and information delivery tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common types of prediction models among the reviewed studies were neural network (49%), classification (42%), and linear models (4.5%). Conclusion(s): The present study showed clinical informatics applications during COVID-19 and identified current gaps in this field. Health information technology and clinical informatics seem to be useful in assisting clinicians and managers to combat COVID-19. The most common domains in clinical informatics for research on the COVID-19 crisis were prediction models and telehealth. It is suggested that future researchers conduct scoping reviews to describe and analyze other levels of medical informatics, including bioinformatics, imaging informatics, and public health informatics.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Computer-based and telecommunication technology has become increasingly common to address addiction among women. This review assessed the effect of technology-based interventions on substance misuse, alcohol use, and smoking outcomes among women. METHOD(S): The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guideline was used to conduct the scoping review. Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were used to search for peer-reviewed articles published in English on computer-based and telecommunication technology use to address substance misuse, alcohol use, and smoking among women. RESULT(S): A total of 30 articles were selected after the final full-text review from the U.S., England, Japan, and the Netherlands. The types of technology used in the interventions included computer software (standalone or web-based), mobile applications, video calling, phone, and text messaging. Intervention outcomes included alcohol and other substance misuse reduction as polysubstance misuse (n=5), smoking cessation (n=10), substance misuse reduction only (n=6), and alcohol use reduction only (n=9). The populations reached included women who were pregnant (n=13), postpartum (n=4), or non-pregnant (n=14) ranging from adolescent to adulthood. Interventions that targeted polysubstance misuse showed statistically significant reductions (p < .05). CONCLUSION(S): Although effective in reducing alcohol and other substance misuse, mixed findings were identified for other outcomes targeting a single substance. Technology-based interventions might maximize their effects by targeting polysubstance misuse and addressing associated contextual issues in the form of a computer-delivered module(s).

Abstract
  To determine the effect of mobile health (mHealth) focused on diet and lifestyle on blood pressure (BP). We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis using the mean difference (MD) of change from baseline as an effect measure. MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE were reviewed until 6 May 2020. We included randomized controlled trials of adults who participated in mHealth focused on diet and lifestyle. Interventions were grouped according to the presence of health professional intervention (PI) (PI + mHealth or mHealth only). Eligible controls did not participate in mHealth and were classified as active comparator (PI) or no intervention (NI). Subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence of prior cardiovascular disease and hypertension status. We included 44 trials involving 24692 participants. Mobile health interventions were superior to NI in reducing SBP in both situations: alone [MD=-1.8mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -3.6; 0.0] or with PI (MD=-5.3mmHg; 95% CI: -7.5; -3.1), with a greater effect size in the latter group (P=0.016). This benefit was not observed when the control was PI. DBP and SBP had consistent results. There was a marked effect of PI + mHealth vs. NI on the BP reduction among hypertensive participants. Current evidence shows that mHealth focused on diet and lifestyle can reduce BP, especially when implemented in hypertensive participants, and PI may provide additional benefit.

Abstract
  Introduction Existing studies have shown that mobile-based mindfulness meditation (MMM) can have a certain impact on nurses' mental health problems, but its specific effect and the effect on specific mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, well-being and resilience are not clear. Methods and analysis This study protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols guidelines. Electronic search through PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Embase and three Chinese databases namely CNKI, Wan Fang and Chinese Biology Medicine disc. The inclusion criteria follow the PICO principle, which is defined translate the question into a searchable and answerable question. P (patient/population): clinical characteristics of patients; I (intervention or exposure): treatment measures or exposure factors of concern; C (comparison): control measure.; O (outcome): outcome indicator of concern. Registered nurses, preregistered nurses, midwives and nursing students will all be included, studies using MMM as intervention to improve mental health of nurses, compared with waitlist controls or traditional methods groups, outcomes assessment of stress, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, well-being and resilience will meet the inclusion criteria. Studies designed randomised controlled trails (RCTs) of quasiexperimental and written in English or Chinese will be eligible. Search time was from inception of each database to July 2022. Two reviewers screen and assess studies for inclusion and extract data independently; any dispute will be settled through discussion. If the discussion still fails, the third author will make a decision. For RCT, risk of bias will be assessed using Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2), and for non-RCT studies, risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool will be performed. Meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan software if sufficient number of comparable studies are retrieved. Ethics and dissemination This is a study protocol of meta-analysis; no primary data will be collected, and no ethics assessment is required. The study results will be presented in a peer-reviewed scientific publication. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021277932.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Abstract
  AIMS: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the suspension of centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) and has underscored the need for home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HBCTR) as a feasible alternative rehabilitation delivery model. Yet, the effectiveness of HBCTR as an alternative to Phase 2 CBCR is unknown. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively appraise the effectiveness of HBCTR. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to January 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HBCTR to Phase 2 CBCR or usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Out of 1588 studies, 14 RCTs involving 2869 CHD patients were included in this review. When compared with usual care, participation in HBCTR showed significant improvement in functional capacity {6-min walking test distance [mean difference (MD) 25.58m, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.74-36.42]}; daily step count (MD 1.05K, 95% CI 0.36-1.75) and exercise habits [odds ratio (OR) 2.28, 95% CI 1.30-4.00)]; depression scores (standardized MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.01) and quality of life [Short-Form mental component summary (MD 2.63, 95% CI 0.06-5.20) and physical component summary (MD 1.99, 95% CI 0.83-3.16)]. Effects on medication adherence were synthesized narratively. HBCTR and CBCR were comparably effective. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with CHD, HBCTR was associated with an increase in functional capacity, physical activity (PA) behaviour, and depression when compared with UC. When HBCTR was compared to CBCR, an equivalent effect on functional capacity, PA behaviour, QoL, medication adherence, smoking behaviour, physiological risk factors, depression, and cardiac-related hospitalization was observed.Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Abstract
  Many aspects of chemistry and biology are mediated by electromagnetic field (EMF) interactions. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly sensitive to EMF stimuli. Studies have explored the direct effect of different EMFs on the electrical properties of neurons in the last two decades, particularly focusing on the role of voltage-gated ion channels (VGCs). This work aims to systematically review published evidence in the last two decades detailing the effects of EMFs on neuronal ion channels as per the PRISM guidelines. Following a predetermined exclusion and inclusion criteria, 22 papers were included after searches on three online databases. Changes in calcium homeostasis, attributable to the voltage-gated calcium channels, were found to be the most commonly reported result of EMF exposure. EMF effects on the neuronal landscape appear to be diverse and greatly dependent on parameters, such as the field's frequency, exposure time, and intrinsic properties of the irradiated tissue, such as the expression of VGCs. Here, we systematically clarify how neuronal ion channels are particularly affected and differentially modulated by EMFs at multiple levels, such as gating dynamics, ion conductance, concentration in the membrane, and gene and protein expression. Ion channels represent a major transducer for EMF-related effects on the CNS.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract
  Aim To compare the effects of different strategies for warfarin self-care. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and OpenGrey were searched from inception to August 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of warfarin self-care, either patient self-testing (PST) or patient self-management (PSM), were included. Self-care approaches were classified based on the TIP framework (theme, intensity, provider): (1) PST >=1/week via e-Health (PST/High/e-Health); (2) PST >=1/week by health care practitioner (PST/High/HCP); (3) PST <1/week via e-Health (PST/Low/e-Health); (4) PSM >=1/week by e-Health (PSM/High/e-Health); (5) PSM >=1/week by patient (PSM/High/Pt); (6) PSM <1/week by patient (PSM/Low/Pt); and (7) PSM with flexible frequency by patient (PSM/Flex/Pt). Mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using frequentist network meta-analyses with a random-effects model. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). Results Sixteen RCTs involving 5,895 participants were included. When compared with usual care, time in therapeutic range was higher in PSM/High/Pt and PST/High/e-Health with MD [95% CI] of 7.67% [0.26-15.08] and 5.65% [0.04-11.26], respectively. The certainty of evidence was rated as moderate for these findings. The risk of thromboembolic events was lower in the PSM/Flex/Pt group when compared with PST/High/e-Health (RR: 0.39 [0.20-0.77]) and usual care (RR: 0.38 [0.17-0.88]) with low and very low level of evidence, respectively. There was no significant difference in the proportion of international normalized ratio (INR) values in range, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality among different self-care features. Conclusion Patient self-care (either PST or PSM) by measuring INR values at least once weekly is more effective in controlling the INR level.Copyright © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Abstract
  Health promotion interventions offer great potential in advocating a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of diseases. Some barriers to communicating health promotion to people of certain cultural groups might be overcome via the internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion interventions among culturally diverse populations. We systematically searched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EbscoHost/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, EbscoHost/PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases in October 2020. Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short- (g = 0.10, [95% CI -0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g = 0.20, [95% CI -0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior. However, culturally adapted IMI for physical activity (k = 3, N = 296) compared to active controls yielded a beneficial effect in long-term (g = 0.48, [95%CI 0.25 to 0.71]). Adapting health promotion IMI to the cultural context of different cultural populations seems not yet to be recommendable given the substantial adaption efforts necessary and the mostly non-significant findings. However, these findings need to be seen as preliminary given the limited number of included trials with varying methodological rigor and the partly substantial between-trial heterogeneity pointing in the direction of potentially useful culturally adapted IMI which now need to be disentangled from the less promising approaches.

Abstract
  Objective: To evaluate analgesic efficacy and safety/tolerability of the nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodic pridinol (PRI) in patients with muscle-related pain. Method(s): Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) according to PRISMA guidelines and Cochrane recommendations. Data sources included Google Scholar, Embase, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Registry, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, and product manufacturer archives from inception to 31 January 2022. Eligibility criteria for study selection were randomized, placebo-controlled trials with PRI in adults (>=18 years) with muscle-related pain. Data extraction, synthesis, and analysis carried out by two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Categorial global response rates (number of patients) based on clinical judgement of study physicians (as primary efficacy endpoint), and response on pain at rest, pain at movement, stiffness, tenderness, and movement restriction (as secondary efficacy endpoints), as well as the number of patients with drug-related adverse events (DRAEs) were meta-analytically evaluated using the Review Manager Software version 5.4.1. Result(s): In total, 38 records were identified, but only two placebo-controlled studies (with 342 patients with mild to moderate acute muscle pain [55.3% female, age 50.6 +/- 16.6 years], of whom 173 received PRI and 169 placebo, each as monotherapy) proved to be suitable for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Treatment with PRI was (irrespective of its mode of administration as oral tablet or intramuscular injection) associated with a significantly higher global response rate compared to placebo (74.0 vs. 49.7%; OR 2.86, 95%-CI: 1.82-4.51; p <.00001; Cohen's h: 0.506, NNT: 4.1; Chi2 for heterogeneity 1.41 (p =.24], I 2  = 29%), and significantly higher response rates were also found for all secondary efficacy endpoints. The safety of PRI was comparable to that of placebo: DRAEs were only seen in one of the two studies and reported for 13 vs. 10 patients (OR: 0.76 95%-CI: 0.32-18.1; p =.54, NNH: 62.6), and related discontinuations were reported for four vs. one patient (2.3 vs. 0.6%; p =.231). Conclusion(s): The results from this meta-analysis as based on two placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with mild to moderate acute muscle pain demonstrate that a 3-week monotherapy with PRI showed a comparable safety profile, but significantly better analgesic effects and improvements of related impairments such as stiffness, tenderness, and movement restrictions compared with placebo-irrespective of its mode of administration.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract
  Background: Digital health refers to the proper use of technology for improving the health and well-being of people and enhancing the care of patients through the intelligent processing of clinical and genetic data. Despite increasing interest in well-being in both health care and technology, there is no clear understanding of what constitutes well-being, which leads to uncertainty in how to create well-being through digital health. In an effort to clarify this uncertainty, Brey developed a framework to define problems in technology for well-being using the following four categories: epistemological problem, scope problem, specification problem, and aggregation problem. Objective(s): This systematic scoping review aims to gain insights into how to define and address well-being in digital health. Method(s): We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Papers were identified from 6 databases and included if they addressed the design or evaluation of digital health and reported the enhancement of patient well-being as their purpose. These papers were divided into design and evaluation papers. We studied how the 4 problems in technology for well-being are considered per paper. Result(s): A total of 117 studies were eligible for analysis (n=46, 39.3% design papers and n=71, 60.7% evaluation papers). For the epistemological problem, the thematic analysis resulted in various definitions of well-being, which were grouped into the following seven values: healthy body, functional me, healthy mind, happy me, social me, self-managing me, and external conditions. Design papers mostly considered well-being as healthy body and self-managing me, whereas evaluation papers considered the values of healthy mind and happy me. Users were rarely involved in defining well-being. For the scope problem, patients with chronic care needs were commonly considered as the main users. Design papers also regularly involved other users, such as caregivers and relatives. These users were often not involved in evaluation papers. For the specification problem, most design and evaluation papers focused on the provision of care support through a digital platform. Design papers used numerous design methods, whereas evaluation papers mostly considered pre-post measurements and randomized controlled trials. For the aggregation problem, value conflicts were rarely described. Conclusion(s): Current practice has found pragmatic ways of circumventing or dealing with the problems of digital health for well-being. Major differences exist between the design and evaluation of digital health, particularly regarding their conceptualization of well-being and the types of users studied. In addition, we found that current methodologies for designing and evaluating digital health can be improved. For optimal digital health for well-being, multidisciplinary collaborations that move beyond the common dichotomy of design and evaluation are needed.Copyright © Merlijn Smits, Chan Mi Kim, Harry van Goor, Geke D S Ludden.

Abstract
  Ensuring people have access to their preferred method of contraception can be key for meeting their reproductive goals. A growing number of mHealth interventions show promise for improving access to contraception, but no literature review has identified the effects of mHealth interventions among both adolescents and adults in the United States. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the format, theoretical basis, and impact of mHealth interventions for contraceptive behavior change (contraceptive initiation and continuation) among people of all ages in the US. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using six electronic databases guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data on study design, frequency, duration, mHealth modality, contraceptive method, behavior change theory, and behavioral outcome were extracted to facilitate comparison. Eighteen studies met eligibility criteria. The majority (11; 61%) used SMS (short message service). Twelve studies focused on contraceptive initiation, most (n = 8) of which also measured continued use over time. The remaining six interventions focused on continuation alone, generally through appointment reminders. Very little contraceptive behavior change was identified across studies. Current mHealth interventions may hold promise for some health areas but there is little evidence that they change contraceptive behavior. Future mHealth interventions should focus on assessing person-centered outcomes, including satisfaction, side effects, and reasons for discontinuation, to best support people to use their preferred contraceptive method.

Abstract
  Background: Racial inequity persists for chronic disease outcomes amid the proliferation of health information technology (HIT) designed to support patients in following recommended chronic disease self-management behaviors (ie, medication behavior, physical activity, and dietary behavior and attending follow-up appointments). Numerous interventions that use consumer-oriented HIT to support self-management have been evaluated, and some of the related literature has focused on racial minorities who experience disparate chronic disease outcomes. However, little is known about the efficacy of these interventions. Objective(s): This study aims to conduct a systematic review of the literature that describes the efficacy of consumer-oriented HIT interventions designed to support self-management involving African American and Hispanic patients with chronic diseases. Method(s): We followed an a priori protocol using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-Equity 2012 Extension guidelines for systematic reviews that focus on health equity. Themes of interest included the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified 7 electronic databases, created search strings, and conducted the searches. We initially screened results based on titles and abstracts and then performed full-text screening. We then resolved conflicts and extracted relevant data from the included articles. Result(s): In total, there were 27 included articles. The mean sample size was 640 (SD 209.5), and 52% (14/27) of the articles focused on African American participants, 15% (4/27) of the articles focused on Hispanic participants, and 33% (9/27) included both. Most articles addressed 3 of the 4 self-management behaviors: medication (17/27, 63%), physical activity (17/27, 63%), and diet (16/27, 59%). Only 15% (4/27) of the studies focused on follow-up appointment attendance. All the articles investigated HIT for use at home, whereas 7% (2/27) included use in the hospital. Conclusion(s): This study addresses a key gap in research that has not sufficiently examined what technology designs and capabilities may be effective for underserved populations in promoting health behavior in concordance with recommendations.Copyright © Charles Senteio, Paul Joseph Murdock.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Dementia was caregivers experience tremendous difficulties both physically and psychologically, leading to high levels of depression and caregiver burden. The advantage of mobile interventions has been recognized due to its freedom from time and space restrictions. OBJECTIVE(S): A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate effectiveness of app-based mobile interventions for dementia caregivers. METHOD(S): We searched nine different databases including CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore, KoreaMed, and RISS for publications on app-based mobile interventions targeting dementia caregivers published in English or Korean. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) version 3.0. Standard mean difference (SMD) was used to estimate the effectiveness of the intervention on caregiver-related outcomes of caregiver burden, depression, stress, caregiving competency, and quality of life (QoL). RESULT(S): Five studies (three randomized controlled trials and two quasi-experimental studies) with a total of 230 participants were included. Using a mobile device, interventions were used to provide information and feedback, perform monitoring, and conduct skill training. Pooled analysis showed favorable effects of app-based mobile interventions for caregivers on caregiver burden (SMD = -0.315, 95% CI: -0.681 to 0.052), depression (SMD = -0.236, 95% CI: -0.517 to 0.046), stress (SMD = -0.295, 95% CI: -0.708 to 0.118), competency (SMD = 0.434, 95% CI: 0.093-0.775), and QoL (SMD = 0.794, 95% CI: 0.310-1.278). CONCLUSION(S): Types of mobile devices, lengths, and contents of interventions varied between included studies. Given that only five studies were included, the current meta-analysis could not confirm the effectiveness of app-based mobile interventions. However, this study suggests that app-based mobile interventions for dementia caregivers might have positive effects on diverse caregiving-related issues such as caregiver burden, depression, stress, competency, and QoL.Copyright © 2022 S.

Abstract
  Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013-2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users' health behaviors.Copyright © 2020

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Health care services ought to be continued for people with serious mental illness (SMI), despite the pandemic events. These efforts help prevent recurrences of any of these medical conditions through the use of telehealth techniques. AIM: The aim of this article is to evaluate the application of telehealth among SMI patients. METHOD(S): This study used a scoping review framework methodology based on the report by Arksey and O'Malley. A comprehensive literature search was carried out to identify precise studies, and vigorous criteria were employed to select the revelant papers. The search was conducted in several databases, including PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Science Direct. Subsequently, the data collected were extracted by two independent reviewers, synthesized and presented in the table and narrative format. RESULT(S): A total of 13 studies were identified in the search selection process based on the review objectives, and 5 of these studies were randomized control trials (RCT), while 8 used varied research designs. CONCLUSION(S): Based on the results of the scoping review, telehealth services were concluded to be suitable for helping people with SMI obtain the required mental health services.Copyright © 2021 Efri Widianti,.

Abstract
  Background: Five to ten percent of patients with hypothyroidism describe persistent symptoms despite being biochemically well regulated on levothyroxine (L-T4). Thyroxine (T4)/triiodothyronine (T3) combination therapy [L-T4/liothyronine (L-T3) or desiccated thyroid] are still regarded as experimental with no evidence of superior effect on persistent symptoms according to meta-analyses. However, some randomized controlled trials have demonstrated patients' preference for T4/T3 combination therapy as compared to L-T4 monotherapy. In 2013, attention to combination therapy increased in Denmark after a patient published a book describing her experiences with hypothyroidism and treatment. Objective(s): To investigate current Danish trends in the use of T4/T3 combination therapy. Method(s): We used an Internet-based questionnaire, distributed as a link via two Danish patient fora. Further, information was obtained from the Division of Pharmacies and Reimbursement at the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and from the only pharmacy in Denmark producing desiccated thyroid and L-T3 tablets. Result(s): A total of 384 patients answered the questionnaire, and 293 responders were included. Sixty-nine percent of the responders had six or more symptoms, and 84% reported a treatment effect. Forty-four percent of the responders received their prescriptions from general practitioners; 50% received desiccated thyroid and 28% reported that they adjust their dose themselves. Responders followed by general practitioners more frequently received desiccated thyroid and adjusted their dose themselves. Conclusion(s): Increased media focus has changed the prescription pattern of thyroid hormones; European guidelines on T4/T3 combination therapy are not always followed in Denmark and many patients adjust their medication themselves and may therefore be at risk of overtreatment.Copyright © 2015 European Thyroid Association Published by S.

Abstract
  Children are the reserve force for national construction, and children's health is now being paid more and more attention. In today's childhood asthma treatment, many are based on the treatment of common cough, and there is no strict division with asthma. Importantly, the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of childhood asthma has been extensively studied in the medical community. However, there is no clear explanation for its specific efficacy and role. Research on childhood asthma has always been a key topic in medicine. This article aims to conduct a meta-analysis of the correlation between inhaled corticosteroids and asthma in children. This article proposes a more scientific literature screening strategy, which can achieve a higher accuracy rate for meta-analysis. It combines the intelligent medical health system in the analysis of children's asthma to assist in the analysis of curative effects. Such analysis also provides reference significance for related research. The experimental results indicate that inhaled corticosteroids have a good effect on childhood asthma. As the concentration of inhaled glucocorticoid increases, the effect will be better. Specifically, if the concentration is increased by 10%, the effect will be about 15% better, but there are corresponding side effects.Copyright © 2022 Yu Qin et al.

Abstract
  Introduction: Due to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, it is pertinent to educate and inform diabetes patients about their self-management. It can be done effectively using innovative methods like mobile health (mHealth), which includes mobile applications, phone calls, and text messages. Thus, this meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for the management of diabetes compared with usual care in the Asian population. Material(s) and Method(s): Searches were performed in electronic databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library, in August and September 2020. Search terms used were "Diabetes Mellitus," "mHealth," "glycemic control", "HbA1c levels," and "Blood glucose levels." The primary outcome was glycated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels. Trials were pooled, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic. Result(s): The search yielded 3980 abstracts, of which 18 trials met the inclusion criteria. Lowering of Hba1c levels was reported in the majority of trials, which aided in Glycemic control. For post prandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, a statistically significant reduction of value -20.13 (95%CI -35.16 to -5.10, P = 0.009, I 2 = 59%) was seen in the mean in the intervention group, whereas for HbA1c levels the mean reduction in the intervention group was -0.44 (95%CI, -0.79 to 0.10, P = 0.01, I 2 = 87%). Although these interventions proved beneficial for these outcomes, there was a difference in the amount of effects caused by different mHealth interventions. Conclusion(s): This study acknowledged the effects of different mHealth interventions as per their accessibility and availability in recent years. There is a need to include more studies in future reviews to generate a larger body of evidence for the reported outcomes. The researchers should give the utmost priority to the transparency while reporting the interventions for effective interpretation of the retrieved data.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Abstract
  Objectives To assess the diagnostic utility of smartphone-based measurement in detecting moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Methods Six databases were thoroughly reviewed. Random-effect models were used to estimate the summary sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, diagnostic odds ratio, summary receiver operating characteristic curve and measured the areas under the curve. To assess the accuracy and precision, pooled mean difference and standard deviation of apnea hypopnea index (AHI) between smartphone and polysomnography (95% limits of agreement) across studies were calculated using the random-effects model. Study methodological quality was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results Eleven studies were analyzed. The smartphone diagnostic odds ratio for moderate-to-severe OSAS (apnea/hypopnea index > 15) was 57.3873 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [34.7462; 94.7815]). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.917. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were 0.9064 [0.8789; 0.9282], 0.8801 [0.8227; 0.9207], 0.9049 [0.8556; 0.9386], and 0.8844 [0.8234; 0.9263], respectively. We performed subgroup analysis based on the various OSAS detection methods (motion, sound, oximetry, and combinations thereof). Although the diagnostic odds ratios, specificities, and negative predictive values varied significantly (all p < 0.05), all methods afforded good sensitivity (> 80%). The sensitivities and positive predictive values were similar for the various methods (both p > 0.05). The mean difference with standard deviation in the AHI between smartphone and polysomnography was -0.6845 +/- 1.611 events/h [-3.8426; 2.4735]. Conclusions Smartphone could be used to screen the moderate-to-severe OSAS. The mean difference between smartphones and polysomnography AHI measurements was small, though limits of agreement was wide. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious when making clinical decisions based on these devices.Copyright: © 2022 Kim et al.

Abstract
  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of 6 Traditional Chinese patent medicines combined with lifestyle modification in the treatment of prediabetes with network meta-analysis. Method(s): The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shen qi jiang tang capsule/granule (Shenqi), Tian mai xiao ke tablet (Tianmai), Tian qi capsule (Tianqi), Jin qi jiang tang tablet (Jinqi), Jin li da granule (Jinlida), Tang mai kang granule (Tangmaikang) in the treatment of prediabetes in PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, EMbase, China Knowledge Network (CNKI), WanFang and Weipu databases were searched. Three reviewers independently conducted the screening, extracted the data and assessed methodological quality. Data analysis was performed using Rev Man 5.3 and STATA 15.0 software. Result(s): A total of 50 RCTs, including 4594 patients, were included. The addition of Shenqi (OR 0.19 [95 %CI: 0.07, 0.52]) and Jinqi (OR 0.32 [95 %CI: 0.15, 0.71]) to existing lifestyle modification resulted in significant lower incidence rate of DM compared with none/placebo added to lifestyle modification. The addition of Jinlida (SMD -0.41% [95 %CI:-0.81, -0.01]) and Tangmaikang (SMD -0.83%[95 %CI: -1.46,-0.20]) resulted in significant additional HbA1c reductions compared with none/placebo added to lifestyle modification. The addition of all CTPMs except Tianqi resulted in significant additional FBG reductions and the addition of Shenqi (SMD -1.96[95 %CI: -3.64, -0.28]) resulted in significant additional PBG reductions. Conclusion(s): For patients with prediabetes, Shenqi + LM was among the most effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes for patients with prediabetes, while Jinlida + LM was among the least effective. Jinqi + LM and Tianqi + LM might be among the most effective, while western oral drugs + LM, Tianmai + LM, Tangmaikang + LM and Placebo + LM might be among the least effective. In addition, Tangmaikang + LM and Jinlida + LM might be among the most effective in reducing HbA1c, while Tianmai + LM, Tangmaikang + LM, Shenqi + LM, Jinlida + LM and Jinqi + LM might be among the most effective in reducing FPG for patients with prediabetes. Yet direct comparison and further investigation to explore mechanisms are warranted.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Background/Aim. Children and adolescents are sensitive groups for the development of mental disorders during the crisis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depressive symptomatology in the population of children and adolescents. Methods. The investigation was based on a systematic review followed by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol, including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and APA Psyc Info databases, to identify relevant studies reporting anxiety and depressive symp-toms among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 27 articles were included. Results. Anxiety symptoms increased from 28.3% before the pan-demic to 49.5% during confinement [General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 >= 11)] (McNemar test, p < 0.0001). More depressive symptomatology was found, as well as weight and sleep disturbances which are the characteristics of children and adolescents' mental health. Additionally, female teenagers were experiencing grater declines in mood disorders than male teenagers during the COVID-19 crisis. On the one hand, different positive correlations between anxiety and other variables, were found, such as clinical depressive symptoms and anxiety (3/14), smartphone and internet addiction (2/14), lower levels of family income (2/14), perceived threats (2/14), higher grades at school (2/14), and loneliness (1/14). On the other hand, positive correlations were reported between depression and children and adolescents that were socially disconnected (3/17). Finally, mothers with higher level of education and income were associated with higher level of happiness (2/17). Conclusion. COVID-19 has a strong impact on the mental health of children and adolescents regarding depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevention programs focused on coping strategies should be conduct-ed in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Mental health should become a priority matter for governments, and the current pandemic could be an op-portunity to highlight the importance of mental well-being and to invest in the betterment of clinical trainings, treat-ments and mental health research.Copyright © 2022 Inst.

Abstract
  Background: Mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) pose a unique challenge to disease elimination campaigns as they are often hard to survey and reach with treatment. While some elimination efforts have had success reaching MMPs, other campaigns are struggling to do so, which may be affecting progress towards disease control and elimination. Therefore, this paper reviews the literature on elimination campaigns targeting MMPs across a selection of elimination diseases-neglected tropical diseases, malaria, trypanosomiasis, polio, smallpox, and rinderpest. Method(s): Through a systematic review process following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a three-person review team identified papers from databases, conference records, and citation searches using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Papers were divided into three key outcome domains during the synthetization process: (1) MMP movement patterns in East Africa including reasons for movement and consequences in terms of health outcomes and healthcare access; (2) MMP contribution to the transmission of disease across all geographies; (3) surveillance methods and treatment interventions used to implement programming in MMPs across all geographies. Experts in the field also provided supplemental information and gray literature to support this review. Result(s): The review identified 103 records which were descriptively analyzed using the outcome domains. The results indicate that in East Africa, there are various motivations for migration from economic opportunity to political unrest to natural disasters. Regardless of motivation, mobile lifestyles affect health service access such that MMPs in East Africa report barriers in accessing healthcare and have limited health knowledge. Often lower service delivery to these populations has resulted in higher disease prevalence. A minority of articles suggest MMPs do not pose challenges to reaching disease control and elimination thresholds. Finally, the literature highlighted surveillance methods (e.g., using satellite imagery or mobile phone data to track movement, participatory mapping, snowball sampling) and intervention strategies (e.g., integration with animal health campaigns, cross-border coordination, alternative mass drug administration [MDA] methods) to implement health interventions in MMPs. Conclusion(s): Ultimately, the literature reviewed here can inform programmatic decisions as the community attempts to reach these never treated populations. Systematic review registration: The protocol for this manuscript was registered with the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (No. CRD42021214743),Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to provide a quantitative review of technology-assisted reading fluency interventions for students with disabilities and select moderator variables that may modify the effects of the interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All reviewed 13 studies employed a single-case research design, targeting technology-assisted reading fluency interventions for students with learning disabilities (LDs) or learning difficulties. Studies were descriptively analysed and evaluated for methodological quality. Additionally, to examine the level and trend of reading fluency outcomes, Tau-U was calculated across the studies by measuring the impact of various moderator variables on the intervention effects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Overall, studies showed a moderate to strong effect on reading fluency and there was a significant difference in moderator variables such as student status, type of technology, and features of technology. While the current study found positive outcomes from technology-based fluency interventions for struggling readers suggesting the effectiveness of using technology for the improvement of reading fluency, educators should consider using a rubric when utilising tablets because of the limited instructional components. Possible explanations about intervention effects, moderator effects, and study qualities along with limitations and future research were discussed. Implications for rehabilitationThis article examined a quantitative review of technology-assisted reading fluency interventions for students with disabilities and those considered at-risk. From this examination, we suggest the following implications:More research is needed to explore the effectiveness of technology-assisted reading fluency interventions. Some studies exist exploring the effect of overall reading interventions, but more specific analyses are needed related specifically to fluency and technology-assisted fluency interventions.Due to continuous advancements in technology, more research is also needed related to the integration of tablets and applications (or apps) on reading fluency.The use of technology to teach fluency has a general positive outcome for at-risk students. However, these types of interventions are more effective if they also provide vocabulary support.

Abstract
  Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior (SB) have attracted growing attention globally since they relate to noninfectious chronic diseases (NCDs) and could further result in the loss of life. This systematic literature review aimed to identify existing evidence on the efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) technology in inducing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior for physically inactive people. Studies were included if they used a smartphone app in an intervention to improve physical activity and/or sedentary behavior for physically inactive individuals. Interventions could be stand-alone interventions or multi-component interventions, including an app as one of several intervention components. A total of nine studies were included, and all were randomized controlled trials. Two studies involved interventions delivered solely via a mobile application (stand-alone intervention) and seven studies involved interventions that used apps and other intervention strategies (multi-component intervention). Methodological quality was assessed, and the overall quality of the studies was ensured. The pooled data favored intervention in improving physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior. This review provided evidence that mobile health intervention improved physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior among inactive individuals. More beneficial effects can be guaranteed when interventions include multiple components. Further studies that maintain the effectiveness of such interventions are required to maximize user engagement and intervention efficacy.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

Abstract
  Background and objectives: The need to monitor patients outside of a formal clinical setting, such as a hospital or ambulatory care facility, has become increasingly important since COVID-19. It introduces significant challenges to ensure accurate and timely measurements, maintain strong patient engagement, and operationalise data for clinical decision-making. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) devices like the pulse oximeter help mitigate these difficulties, however, practical approaches to successfully integrate this technology into existing patient-clinician interactions that ensure the delivery of safe and effective care are vital. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesise existing literature to provide an overview of the variety of user perceptions associated with pulse oximeter devices, which may impact patients' and clinicians' acceptance of the devices in a RPM context. Method(s): A search over three databases was conducted between April 2021 - June 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A total of 16 articles were included in this scoping review. Result(s): Results indicate there has been an increase in use of pulse oximeters across hospital and community settings for continuous vital signs monitoring and remote monitoring of patients over time. Research in this area is shifting towards increasing accessibility of care through the development and implementation of telehealth systems and phone oximeters. Aspects of pulse oximeter UX most frequently investigated are usability and acceptability, however, these terms are often undefined, or definitions vary across studies. Perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs, and attitude towards use remain unexplored areas of UX. Overall, patients and clinicians view the pulse oximeter positively and find it user-friendly. A high level of learnability was found for the device and additional benefits included increasing patient self-efficacy and clinician motivation to work. However, issues getting an accurate reading due to device usability are still experienced by some patients and clinicians. Conclusion(s): This scoping review is the first to summarise user perceptions of the pulse oximeter in a healthcare context. It showed that both patients and clinicians hold positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter and important factors to consider in designing user-focused services include ease-of-use and wearability of devices; context of use including user's prior health and IT knowledge; attitude towards use and perceived effectiveness; impact on user motivation and self-efficacy; and finally, potential user costs like inconvenience or increased anxiety. With the rapid increase in research studies examining pulse oximeter use for RPM since COVID-19, a systematic review is warranted as the next step to consolidate evidence and investigate the impact of these factors on pulse oximeter acceptance and effectiveness.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps are revolutionizing the way clinicians and researchers monitor and manage the health of their participants. However, many studies using mHealth apps are hampered by substantial participant dropout or attrition, which may impact the representativeness of the sample and the effectiveness of the study. Therefore, it is imperative for researchers to understand what makes participants stay with mHealth apps or studies using mHealth apps. Objective(s): This study aimed to review the current peer-reviewed research literature to identify the notable factors and strategies used in adult participant engagement and retention. Method(s): We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases for mHealth studies that evaluated and assessed issues or strategies to improve the engagement and retention of adults from 2015 to 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Notable themes were identified and narratively compared among different studies. A binomial regression model was generated to examine the factors affecting retention. Result(s): Of the 389 identified studies, 62 (15.9%) were included in this review. Overall, most studies were partially successful in maintaining participant engagement. Factors related to particular elements of the app (eg, feedback, appropriate reminders, and in-app support from peers or coaches) and research strategies (eg, compensation and niche samples) that promote retention were identified. Factors that obstructed retention were also identified (eg, lack of support features, technical difficulties, and usefulness of the app). The regression model results showed that a participant is more likely to drop out than to be retained. Conclusion(s): Retaining participants is an omnipresent challenge in mHealth studies. The insights from this review can help inform future studies about the factors and strategies to improve participant retention.Copyright © Saki Amagai, Sarah Pila, Aaron J Kaat, Cindy J Nowinski, Richard C Gershon.

Abstract
  This systematic review provides an overview of the effects of menopausal symptom treatment options on palpitations, defined as feelings of missed or exaggerated heart beats, reported by perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO to identify articles meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. Of 670 unique articles identified, 37 were included in the review. Treatments included drug therapies and non-drug therapies. Palpitations were studied as an outcome in 89% of articles and as an adverse effect in 11%. Articles provided mostly level II/III evidence due to their design and/or small sample sizes. Based on available evidence, no therapies can be fully recommended for clinical practice. Only some hormonal agents (e.g. estradiol) can be recommended with caution based on some positive evidence for reducing palpitation prevalence or severity. However, other drug therapies (e.g. moxonidine, atenolol), dietary supplementary treatments (e.g. isoflavones, Rheum rhaponticum, sage), cognitive-behavioral intervention and auricular acupressure cannot be recommended given the existing evidence. Additional well-designed randomized controlled treatment trials focusing on palpitations during the menopause transition as an inclusion criteria and outcome are needed to advance the field.Copyright © 2021 International Menopause Society.

Abstract
  Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a global cause of morbidity and mortality with over 60 million estimated cases worldwide. The burden of HF care is expected to increase with an ageing population as evidenced by the fact that 80% of HF-related hospitalizations occur in those aged above 65. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with HFrEF, there is a need for new prognostic therapies that have an impact on morbidity and mortality. In February of 2021, the National institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released new guidance on the utility of Dapagliflozin for the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). NICE advocated that dapagliflozin is a viable treatment option in symptomatic HFrEF patients on optimal medical management. The current list price of dapagliflozin is around 36.59 per 28-tablet pack with an estimated annual cost of 476.98 equating to 6939 per quality-adjusted life year. The guidance was mainly based on evidence produced from the 2019 DAPA-HF trial. This demonstrated that in HFrEF population, the use of dapagliflozin led to a significant reduction in worsening HF events, cardiovascular, and all-cause death. In this article, we summarize the evidence base for sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in the non-diabetic heart failure patient.Copyright © 2021 British Pharmacological Society.

Abstract
  Background: Applications emitting radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF; 100 kHz to 300 GHz) are widely used for communication (e.g. mobile phones), in medicine (diathermy) and in industry (RF heaters). Concern has been raised that RF-EMF exposure affects health related quality of life, because a part of the population reports to experience a variety of symptoms related to low exposure levels below regulatory limits. Objective(s): To systematically review the effects of longer-term or repeated local and whole human body RF-EMF exposure on the occurrence of symptoms evaluating migraine, tinnitus, headaches, sleep disturbances and composite symptom scores as primary outcomes. Method(s): We will follow the WHO handbook for guideline development. For the development of the systematic review protocol we considered handbook for conducting systematic reviews for health effects evaluations from the National Toxicology Program-Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP-OHAT) and COSTER (Recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews in toxicology and environmental health research). Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies in the general population or workers aiming to investigate the association between local or whole-body RF-EMF exposure for at least one week and symptoms are eligible for inclusion. Only cohort, case-control and panel studies will be included. Information sources: We will search the scientific literature databases Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos and Embase, using a predefined search strategy. This search will be supplemented by a search in the EMF-Portal and checks of reference lists of relevant papers and reviews. Study appraisal and synthesis method: Data from included papers will be extracted according to predefined forms. Findings will be summarized in tables, graphical displays and in a narrative synthesis of the available evidence, complemented with meta-analyses. We will separately review effects of local, far field and occupational exposure. Risk of Bias: The internal validity of included studies will be assessed using the NTP-OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies, elaborated to observational RF-EMF studies. Evidence appraisal: To rate certainty of the evidence, we will use the OHAT GRADE-based approach for epidemiological studies. Framework and funding: This protocol concerns one of the ten different systematic reviews considered in a larger systematic review of the World Health Organization to assess potential health effects of exposure to RF-EMF in the general and working population.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents increasingly do not meet physical activity (PA) recommendations. Hence, insufficient PA (IPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) among children and adolescents are relevant behavior change domains for using individualized mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE(S): This review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on IPA and SB, with a special focus on the age and level of individualization. METHOD(S): PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and March 2021. mHealth interventions for primary prevention in children and adolescents addressing behavior change related to IPA and SB were included. Included studies were compared for content characteristics and methodological quality and summarized narratively. In addition, a meta-analysis with a subsequent exploratory meta-regression examining the moderating effects of age and individualization on overall effectiveness was performed. RESULT(S): On the basis of the inclusion criteria, 1.3% (11/828) of the preliminary identified studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 1.2% (10/828) were included in the meta-analysis. Trials included a total of 1515 participants (mean age (11.69, SD 0.788 years; 65% male and 35% female) self-reported (3/11, 27%) or device-measured (8/11, 73%) health data on the duration of SB and IPA for an average of 9.3 (SD 5.6) weeks. Studies with high levels of individualization significantly decreased insufficient PA levels (Cohen d=0.33; 95% CI 0.08-0.58; Z=2.55; P=.01), whereas those with low levels of individualization (Cohen d=-0.06; 95% CI -0.32 to 0.20; Z=0.48; P=.63) or targeting SB (Cohen d=-0.11; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.23; Z=1.73; P=.08) indicated no overall significant effect. The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate to low, and significant subgroup differences were found between trials with high and low levels of individualization (chi21=4.0; P=.04; I2=75.2%). Age as a moderator variable showed a small effect; however, the results were not significant, which might have been because of being underpowered. CONCLUSION(S): Evidence suggests that mHealth interventions for children and adolescents can foster moderate reductions in IPA but not SB. Moreover, individualized mHealth interventions to reduce IPA seem to be more effective for adolescents than for children. Although, to date, only a few mHealth studies have addressed inactive and sedentary young people, and their quality of evidence is moderate, these findings indicate the relevance of individualization on the one hand and the difficulties in reducing SB using mHealth interventions on the other.

Abstract
  Mobile phone technologies to alert citizen first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) were implemented in numerous countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate whether activating citizen first responders increases bystanders' interventions and improves outcomes. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 24 November 2021, for studies comparing citizen first responders' activation versus standard emergency response in the case of OHCA. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge or 30 days. Secondary outcomes were discharge with favourable neurological outcome, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) before ambulance arrival. Evidence certainty was evaluated with GRADE. Our search strategy yielded 1215 articles. After screening, we included 10 studies for a total of 23 351 patients. OHCAs for which citizen first responders were activated had higher rates of survival at hospital discharge or 30 days compared with standard emergency response [nine studies; 903/9978 (9.1%) vs. 1104/13 247 (8.3%); odds ratio (OR), 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.74; P < 0.001], return of spontaneous circulation [nine studies; 2575/9169 (28%) vs. 3445/12 607 (27%); OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.81; P = 0.01], bystander-initiated CPR [eight studies; 5876/9074 (65%) vs. 6384/11 970 (53%); OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.43-2.15; P < 0.001], and AED use [eight studies; 654/9132 (7.2%) vs. 624/14 848 (4.2%); OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.31-2.53; P < 0.001], but similar rates of neurological intact discharge [three studies; 316/2685 (12%) vs. 276/2972 (9.3%); OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.81-2.33; P = 0.24]. Alerting citizen first responders to OHCA patients is associated with higher rates of bystander-initiated CPR, use of AED before ambulance arrival, and survival at hospital discharge or 30 days.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Abstract
  The re-emerging of vaccine preventable diseases is a global public health burgeoning issue. The incompleteness of vaccination or low uptake rate is due to low awareness of the importance of vaccines, forgetfulness, poor counselling, and health education from the healthcare providers. Mobile phone messaging reminder was one of the most studied interventions to overcome these problems in the last decade due to increasing usage of mobile phones in daily living activities. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of mobile phone messaging intervention on vaccination programmes of preventable diseases worldwide. Methods. A systematic literature search of randomised controlled trials on Cochrane database that were published for the past 10 years was done; in which 10 articles were selected for critical appraisal and qualitative synthesis. Out of the 10 articles, 9 articles were selected and proceeded with meta-analysis based on GRADE risk of bias assessment. Results. The overall vaccination coverage of mobile phone messaging in the intervention group was higher than the control group [61,586 (47.7%) versus 61,571(45.7%)] with significant pooled vaccination prevalence difference (PD) of 0.02 (CI 0.01, 0.03). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled PD of childhood vaccination coverage was not significant although significant pooled PD of 0.03 (CI 0.01, 0.04) was detected in the influenza vaccination coverage. Conclusion. This review and meta-analysis have strengthened the evidence that mobile phone messaging is an effective intervention method to increase vaccination coverage, especially for influenza vaccination. However, its effect on childhood vaccination coverage was inconclusive and needed more high quality research.Copyright © 2022, Dynasty Publishing House. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Background and aims: Self-management is critical to manage the glycemic and metabolic outcomes for patients with diabetes. Telehealth applications are recognized as a potential approach to promote self-management of people with type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of telehealth on self-management among patients with type 2 diabetes. Method(s): A systematic review was conducted on several databases, including PubMed, EbscoHost Medline, and Science Direct, with the keywords: Diabetes Mellitus AND Mobile-phone based OR Telemedicine OR Telehealth OR Web-based OR Telenursing AND Self-management. Inclusion criteria were articles with type 2 diabetic respondents, published between 2015 and 2020, open-access articles, and had self-management as outcomes. Hence, qualitative, protocol, or review articles, commentaries, letters to editors, and case study/reports were excluded. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools and Cochrane collaboration's tools were used for assessing risk of bias. Result(s): The total of six studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, with five randomized control trials and one cross-sectional study. Telehealth applications were formed as an online or app-based platform with the key features of educational programs, text or voice messages, consultations and counseling, and active participation of the subjects. Besides improving the self-management outcomes, the telehealth also indicated improvements in positive behaviors, attitudes, and the intention of self-management. Conclusion(s): The study concluded that implementation of telehealth provided positive self-management results among patients with type 2 diabetes. The users need to consider an intensive training, peer or family support, and provision of full support for the patients during the implementation of telehealth.Copyright © 2022 Diabetes India

Abstract
  People who are overweight and obese suffer from significant health impacts that have increased globally. Concurrently, usage of information and communication devices such as television and mobile phones have also been growing, affecting people's weight. This study examined the association between watching television and owning a mobile phone with overweight and obesity among reproductive-aged women in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). Data of 21 LLMICs reported between 2015 and 2020 were collected from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the association into three pooled segments: a group of 21 countries, the World Bank income classification and the regional categorisation of the countries. The all-inclusive prevalence of overweight or obesity was found at 27.1% among 175,370 reproductive-aged women, and this prevalence varied among countries. Overall, the odds of being overweight or obese were 1.20 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-1.24), 1.40 (AOR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.35-1.44) and 1.18 (AOR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.35) times higher among those who watched television less than once a week, at least once a week and almost every day, respectively, compared with those who did not watch television. Besides, women's mobile phone ownership is more likely to experience overweight or obesity (AOR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.67-1.77). Consistent results were found for the countries categorised according to the World Bank income and regional classification. Focus on sedentary behaviour, such as television watching and mobile phone use, of women and regional or country-specific innovative strategies and programs are of great immediate importance to decrease the prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Abstract
  Objective: To conduct the meta- analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) on clinical trials of fire needling therapy in treatment of gouty arthritis and review systematically the clinical therapeutic effect of fire needling therapy on gouty arthritis so as to provide the medical evidences of the extensive application of this therapy in treatment of gouty arthritis. Method(s): The relevant clinical trials of fire needling therapy for treatment of gouty arthritis were searched from China National knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, American Medical Online, Dutch Medical Literature Database and International Evidence-Based Medical library. Using Review Manager 5.3 software, the quality of the included trials was assessed and meta-analysis was performed. With TSA v0.9 software, the trial sequential analysis was conduced on the appropriate outcomes. Result(s): A total of 10 trials were included with 775 patients involved. The analysis results showed that compared with the western medication, the total effective rate (RR = 1.14'95%CI [1.09,1.20]), the curative rate (RR = 1.59'95%CI [1.33,1.89]), the reduced VAS score (MD = -1.44' 95%CI [-1.93,-0.95]) and the reduced incidence of adverse reaction (RR = 0.27' 95% CI [0.09,0.76]) of the fire needling therapy were different significantly (all P < 0.05). Regarding the reduction of blood uric acid (MD = -40.47' 95%CI [-80.21,-0.72]) and the score of symptoms and physical signs (MD = -1.38'95% CI [-3.71, 0.95]), the effect of fire needling therapy was similar to that of western medication group (both P >= 0.05). The trial sequential analysis suggested that the result was reliable, in which, the total effective rate of fire needling therapy was much higher than the western medication. But, it was potentially a false-positive finding, in which, fire needling therapy was much more advantageous at reducing blood uric acid as compared with the western medication. Conclusion(s): Based on the analytic results, it can be determined that fire needling therapy, as an effective approach to the treatment of gouty arthritis, has a certain advantage as compared with western medication. Given the low overall quality of trials, it still needs high-quality clinical trial to verify the findings of this study results.Copyright © 2021

Abstract
  Background: Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. eHealth interventions provide a promising and accessible treatment alternative to face-to-face interventions. Objective(s): The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in preventing and treating depression, anxiety, and insomnia during pregnancy. Secondary aims are to identify demographic and intervention moderators of effectiveness. Method(s): A total of 5 databases (PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to May 2021. Terms related to eHealth, pregnancy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), depression, anxiety, and insomnia were included. RCTs and pilot RCTs were included if they reported an eHealth intervention for the prevention or treatment of depression, anxiety, or insomnia in pregnant women. Study screening, data extractions, and quality assessment were conducted independently by 2 reviewers from an 8-member research team (KAS, PRS, Hangsel Sanguino, Roshni Sohail, Jasleen Kaur, Songyang (Mark) Jin, Makayla Freeman, and Beatrice Valmana). Random-effects meta-analyses of pooled effect sizes were conducted to determine the effect of eHealth interventions on prenatal mental health. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. Result(s): In total, 17 studies were included in this review that assessed changes in depression (11/17, 65%), anxiety (10/17, 59%), and insomnia (3/17, 18%). Several studies included both depression and anxiety symptoms as outcomes (7/17, 41%). The results indicated that during pregnancy, eHealth interventions showed small effect sizes for preventing and treating symptoms of anxiety and depression and a moderate effect size for treating symptoms of insomnia. With the exception of intervention type for the outcome of depressive symptoms, where mindfulness interventions outperformed other intervention types, no significant moderators were detected. Conclusion(s): eHealth interventions are an accessible and promising resource for treating symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia during pregnancy. However, more research is necessary to identify ways to increase the efficacy of eHealth interventions for this population.Copyright © 2022 Katherine A Silang, Pooja R Sohal, Katherine S Bright, Jennifer Leason, Leslie Roos, Catherine Lebel, Gerald F Giesbrecht, Lianne M Tomfohr-Madsen.

Abstract
  The skin cancer incidence rate has been rising, and digital health interventions can promote skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcomes of digital interventions that promote sun protection and skin self-examination (SSE). This review examined studies that utilized randomized controlled designs or quasi-experiments, included outcomes related to sun safety or SSE, employed at least one digital platform, and were published in English from January 2000 to October 2020. A total of 62 studies were included in the review. Digital modalities included web-based (e.g., websites) alone (n = 29), mobile-based (e.g., mobile apps) alone (n = 12), game-based (n = 1), emails or text messages alone (n = 8), videos alone (n = 6), social media (n = 3), both text messages and mobile apps (n = 2), or both text messages and video (n = 1). Most studies (n = 44) only evaluated sun protection-related outcomes, seven studies assessed SSE outcomes only, nine studies examined both, and two assessed other related outcomes. Digital interventions are effective compared to non-intervention control conditions in promoting sun safety or SSE. Almost all studies found digital interventions to be equally or more effective compared to non-digital interventions. This review suggests that although the digital interventions varied, they showed promising effects on improving sun protection or SSE outcomes. Future research should include more sophisticated phase-based and rigorous longitudinal research designs, additional investigation of social media and other newer technologies, as well as more detailed reporting of methods and results.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

Abstract
  Aim: We aimed to systematically review the available literature on mobile Health (mHealth) solutions, including handheld and wearable devices, implantable loop recorders (ILRs), as well as mobile platforms and support systems in atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and management. Method(s): This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed (NCBI), Embase (Ovid), and Cochrane were searched for articles published until 10 February 2021, inclusive. Given that the included studies varied widely in their design, interventions, comparators, and outcomes, no synthesis was undertaken, and we undertook a narrative review. Result(s): We found 208 studies, which were deemed potentially relevant. Of these studies included, 82, 46, and 49 studies aimed at validating handheld devices, wearables, and ILRs for AF detection and/or management, respectively, while 34 studies assessed mobile platforms/support systems. The diagnostic accuracy of mHealth solutions differs with respect to the type (handheld devices vs wearables vs ILRs) and technology used (electrocardiography vs photoplethysmography), as well as application setting (intermittent vs continuous, spot vs longitudinal assessment), and study population. Conclusion(s): While the use of mHealth solutions in the detection and management of AF is becoming increasingly popular, its clinical implications merit further investigation and several barriers to widespread mHealth adaption in healthcare systems need to be overcome.

Abstract
  The stroke burden continues to grow across the globe, disproportionally affecting developing countries. This burden cannot be effectively halted and reversed without effective and widely implemented primordial and primary stroke prevention measures, including those on the individual level. The unprecedented growth of smartphone and other digital technologies with digital solutions are now being used in almost every area of health, offering a unique opportunity to improve primordial and primary stroke prevention on the individual level. However, there are several issues that need to be considered to advance development and use this important digital strategy for primordial and primary stroke prevention. Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines we provide a systematic review of the current knowledge, challenges, and opportunities of digital health in primordial and primary stroke prevention.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Abstract
  Background: To conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between mobile phone addiction (MPA) and sleep disorder (SD) by reviewing current evidence from observational studies. Method(s): The meta-analysis was conducted by searching Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of science using a retrieval strategy related to MPA and SD. Pooled Odds ratios and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated by R software using a random effects model. Result(s): 29 studies including a total of 20041 participants were identified. We found that MPA was significantly associated with an increased risk of adolescents having SD (OR = 2.25, 95%CI= 1.72-2.94). Additionally, the findings also demonstrated that weak-to-moderate positive correlations were found between MPA and SD (summary r = 0.30, 95%CI= 0.25-0.34). The meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis suggested that the geographic location and the measurement of MPA might be the sources of heterogeneity, and the robustness of the findings was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. Limitation(s): The information collected was self-reported, and the recall bias was inevitable. Conclusion(s): This study updated the findings of the association between MPA and SD from the previous reviews and was also the first meta-analysis to assess the association between MPA and SD using Odds Radios and correlation coefficients concurrently. The result of this study re-emphasized that paying more attention to the public health concerns of MPA and SD is needed in the future, whether implementation more relevant researches or developing targeted policies.Copyright © 2022

Abstract
  Objective:To determine the effects of glucocorticoids in enhancing athletic performance. Design(s):At least 2 independent reviewers conducted study selection and extracted demographic and outcome data. Relevant outcomes were stratified by administration time frame and the specific type of drug used. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool and the Cochrane Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Education scale. Where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. Data sources: Embase, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus were searched from their beginning to April 2020. Participant(s):Participants of any sex and training status aged 18 to 65 years were included.Interventions and Main Outcome Measure(s):Any type of published randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examined any enhancement in sport as well as aerobic, anaerobic, or body compositional parameters for glucocorticoids compared with placebo. Result(s):There is low-to-moderate evidence suggesting that the administration of glucocorticoids may be more beneficial than placebo in enhancing athletic performance. short-term administration of glucocorticoids significantly improved time to exhaustion, maximal force, and total distance travelled. By contrast, acute administration of glucocorticoids predominantly yielded no changes to athletic performance, except for reductions in total work and maximal power output. Conclusion(s):Although there is evidence suggesting glucocorticoids have ergogenic effects, these improvements may differ depending on the specific type of drug, dose, and the administration time frame and are also limited by small sample sizes. Therefore, there is a need for large, high-quality RCTs as this may influence future doping policy and athlete care.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the effectiveness of contactless vital sign monitors that utilize a consumer-friendly camera versus medical grade instruments. A multiple database search was conducted from inception to September 2020. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies that used a consumer-grade camera (smartphone/webcam) to examine contactless vital signs in adults; evaluated the non-contact device against a reference medical device; and used the participants' face for measurement. Twenty-six studies were included in the review of which 16 were included in Pearson's correlation and 14 studies were included in the Bland-Altman meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies measured heart rate (HR) (92%), three measured blood pressure (BP) (12%), and respiratory rate (RR) (12%). No study examined blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Most studies had a small sample size (<= 30 participants) and were performed in a laboratory setting. Our meta-analysis found that consumer-grade contactless vital sign monitors were accurate in comparison to a medical device in measuring HR. Current contactless monitors have limitations such as motion, poor lighting, and lack of automatic face tracking. Currently available consumer-friendly contactless monitors measure HR accurately compared to standard medical devices. More studies are needed to assess the accuracy of contactless BP and RR monitors. Implementation of contactless vital sign monitors for clinical use will require validation in a larger population, in a clinical setting, and expanded to encompass other vital signs including BP, RR, and SpO2.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Abstract
  Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Xiaoxianxiong Decoction in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Method(s): CNKI, Wan Fang, VIP, Sino Med, Cochrane Library and Pub were searched by computer Randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of Xiaoxianxiong Decoction in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from the establishment of Med and other Chinese and English databases to December 2021. Literatures was screened and extracted according to the exclusion criteria, Cochranev5.1.0 bias risk assessment tool and modified Jadad scale were used to evaluate the quality of the included literatures, and Rev Man5.3 software was used for Meta-analysis. Result(s): (1) Eleven articles were included, including 873 patients; (2) Meta-analysis showed that the total effective rate of Xiaoxiangxiong Decoction in treating GERD was higher than that of the control group [P = 0.89, I2 = 0%, OR = 3.48, 95%CI (2.29, 5.30), Z = 5.84, P < 0.00001]. Compared with other conventional western medicine therapies, acid reflux symptoms were significantly improved [WMD = -0.30, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.01], Z = 2.06, P = 0.04 (subgroup 1); WMD = -0.17, 95%CI [-0.44, 0.11], Z = 1.18, P = 0.24 (subgroup 2); WMD = -0.17, 95%CI [-0.44, 0.11], Z = 1.18, P = 0.24 (subgroup 2). WMD = -0.14, 95%CI [-0.37, 0.08], Z = 1.23, P = 0.22 (subgroup3)]; The recurrence rate was lower [OR = 0.13, 95%CI [0.05, 0.37], Z = 3.89, P < 0.0001]; There was no significant difference in the improvement of heartburn and retrosternal pain symptoms between the experimental group and the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Compared with other conventional western medicine therapies, Xiaoxianxiong Decoction has a higher total effective rate and lower recurrence rate in the treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease, and has certain advantages in alleviating acid reflux symptoms, but has no obvious advantages in improving heartburn and retrosternal pain symptoms.Copyright 2022 By Author(s).

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Over the past 2 decades, overweight and obesity rates have increased exponentially, along with related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. The Mediterranean Diet (MDiet) has been suggested as a potential way to mitigate the health burdens related to overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVE(S): For this review, the literature on MDiet-focused digital interventions was examined to determine efficacy, best practices, and potential limitations. DATA SOURCES: The search was conducted across 15 databases for relevant publications published through April 2020 in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, or Italian. DATA EXTRACTION: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed using a combination of keywords and phrases and evaluated independently for relevance, merit, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. DATA ANALYSIS: The systematic literature review resulted in 15 articles that met the search criteria. Ten interventions were delivered online, and 5 were delivered via smartphone using an app. The majority of online MDiet-focused interventions were effective, particularly when modeled after evidence-based and best-practice online nutrition education interventions. Such interventions also are effective for promoting positive health behaviors and health outcomes, such as increased physical activity, increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a lower total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. CONCLUSION(S): Technology-based interventions to educate and promote adherence to the MDiet are successful in helping individuals achieve the stated outcomes. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of MDiet interventions delivered via smartphone apps.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In recent years, the detection rate of pregnancy complicated with hypothyroidism [subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy] has increased significantly. Levothyroxine sodium tablet is the main drug for the treatment of SCH during pregnancy, but its effect on the treatment of SCH during pregnancy and the effect of pregnancy outcome are still controversial. METHOD(S): PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and Embase databases were screened to retrieve clinical studies on levothyroxine sodium tablets in the treatment of pregnancy complicated with hypothyroidism from the date of establishment to June 2021. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.3 software. The differences in the incidence of preterm birth, miscarriage, gestational hypertension, postpartum hemorrhage, placental abruption, and abnormal neonatal weight were compared between the observation group and the control group. Heterogeneity of results was assessed with chi-square test and I2 in RevMan5.3 software. RESULT(S): Nine articles with a total of 2,873 pregnant women were included. The Cochrane assessments were all grade B and above, and the Jadad scale scores were all >3 points. The incidences of preterm birth, abortion, postpartum hemorrhage, and low birth weight infants in the pregnant women treated with levothyroxine sodium were lower than those in the control group [odds ratio (OR) =0.42, 0.34, 0.40, and 0.08, respectively; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.58, 0.23-0.52, 0.22-0.74, and 0.01-0.51, respectively; Z=5.23, 5.08, 2.97, and 2.70, respectively; P<0.00001, <0.00001, =0.003, and =0.007, respectively]. DISCUSSION: Levothyroxine sodium in the treatment of SCH can significantly reduce the incidence of premature birth, miscarriage, postpartum hemorrhage, and low birth weight infants. Due to the limited number of included studies, it remained to be further verified whether levothyroxine sodium treatment in SCH patients would affect the incidence of gestational hypertension.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Advances in the device and smartphone technology have resulted in a convenient option for providing physical activity strategies; this is especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of wearable and smartphone-based interventions to promote physical activity and improve quality of life and cardiovascular health outcomes among overweight/obese adults. DATA SOURCES: We searched relevant databases up to 18 November 2021 for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials lasting 4 or more weeks that investigated the impacts of wearables and smartphone applications on physical activity, quality of life and health outcomes. RESULT(S): Twenty-six studies including 2373 participants were included. There was a significant pooled standard mean differences (SMD) for the comparison between intervention versus control in steps per day (SMD: 0.54; p = 0.0003), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (SMD: 0.47; p = 0.02), quality of life (SMD: 0.33; p = 0.0006), body weight (mean difference (MD), -1.61 kg; p = 0.009), and BMI (MD, -0.59 kg/m2; p = 0.04). There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that wearable and smartphone-based interventions are effective strategies in promoting physical activity and can provide a direct contact line to health professionals.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) tools have emerged as a promising health care technology that may contribute to cost savings, better access to care, and enhanced clinical outcomes; however, it is important to ensure their acceptance and adoption to harness this potential. Patient adoption has been recognized as a key challenge that requires further exploration. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this review was to systematically investigate the literature to understand the factors affecting patients' adoption of mHealth tools by considering sociotechnical factors (from technical, social, and health perspectives). METHOD(S): A structured search was completed following the participants, intervention, comparators, and outcomes framework. We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and SAGE databases for studies published between January 2011 and July 2021 in the English language, yielding 5873 results, of which 147 studies met the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook were followed to ensure a systematic process. Extracted data were analyzed using NVivo (QSR International), with thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of emergent themes. RESULT(S): The technical factors affecting patients' adoption of mHealth tools were categorized into six key themes, which in turn were divided into 20 subthemes: usefulness, ease of use, data-related, monetary factors, technical issues, and user experience. Health-related factors were categorized into six key themes: the disease or health condition, the care team's role, health consciousness and literacy, health behavior, relation to other therapies, integration into patient journey, and the patients' insurance status. Social and personal factors were divided into three key clusters: demographic factors, personal characteristics, and social and cultural aspects; these were divided into 19 subthemes, highlighting the importance of considering these factors when addressing potential barriers to mHealth adoption and how to overcome them. CONCLUSION(S): This review builds on the growing body of research that investigates patients' adoption of mHealth services and highlights the complexity of the factors affecting adoption, including personal, social, technical, organizational, and health care aspects. We recommend a more patient-centered approach by ensuring the tools' fit into the overall patient journey and treatment plan, emphasizing inclusive design, and warranting comprehensive patient education and support. Moreover, empowering and mobilizing clinicians and care teams, addressing ethical data management issues, and focusing on health care policies may facilitate adoption.Copyright ©Christine Jacob, Emre Sezgin, Antonio Sanchez-Vazquez, Chris Ivory.

Abstract
  Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular risk factor for acute cardiovascular outcomes, including acute coronary disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Despite the fact that it represents the most prevalent risk factor in the general population, mostly in elderly individuals, its awareness is still relatively low, being about one third of patients living with undiagnosed hypertension and high risk of experiencing acute cardiovascular events. In addition, though recent improvement in pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options, hypertension is largely uncontrolled, with about 35-40% of treated hypertensive patients achieving the recommended therapeutic targets. Among different modern interventions proposed for improving blood pressure control in treated hypertensive patients, a systematic adoption of home BP monitoring has demonstrated to be one of the most effective. Indeed, it improves patients' awareness of the disease and adherence to prescribed medications and allows tailoring and personalizing BP lowering therapies. Home BP monitoring is particularly suitable for telemedicine and mobile-health solutions. Indeed, in specific conditions, when face-to-face interactions between patients and physicians are not allowed or even suspended, as in case of COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine may ensure effective management of hypertension, as well as other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. This review will summarize strengths and limitations of telemedicine in the clinical management of hypertension with a particular focus on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2021, Italian Society of Hypertension.

Abstract
  Objectives: This systematic review aimed to analyze the use of telehealth in monitoring patients with head and neck cancer regarding the application used, user adherence to technology, user satisfaction, and user quality of life. Material(s) and Method(s): A search strategy was developed using the PICO acronym and the terms "Head and Neck Cancer," "Telehealth," "Mobile Application," and "Supportive Care." A broad literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, and Embase databases and on grey literature through Open Grey, Google Scholar, and Jstor, for studies comparing the monitoring of head and neck cancer patients with telehealth apps to the monitoring performed in a traditional way at health units. No study design, publication status, publication time, or language restrictions were applied. Pairs of reviewers worked independently for study selection and risk of bias assessment. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO and the PRISMA checklist used for reporting the review. Result(s): We found 393 references in the databases, 325 after duplicate removal; 19 met the criteria for full-text reading; 08 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Although there was heterogeneity regarding the technology used, the studies included showed that remote monitoring and/or self-management of symptoms through mobile applications was feasible for most patients, with satisfactory degrees of acceptability, satisfaction, usability, and adherence. The health-related quality of life improved with the use of remote technologies for telehealth, associated with low to moderate self-efficacy, higher personal control, and higher knowledge of health with clinically acceptable levels of accuracy compared to traditional clinical evaluation. Even when the data presented were not statistically significant, patients reported improvement in health-related quality of life after the intervention. Conclusion(s): Telehealth monitoring through the use of remote technologies presents itself as an alternative way of educating and supporting patients during the treatment of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). There is the need for a more user-friendly interface, adequate user experience assessment, and the concrete applicability of telehealth technologies for monitoring patients with HNC in order to legitimize the cost-effectiveness of developing long-term multicenter longitudinal studies term.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  Background: The poor coverage of essential maternal services, such as antenatal care (ANC) and skilled delivery care utilization, accounts for higher maternal and infant mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although mobile health (mHealth) interventions could potentially improve the service utilization in resource-limited settings, their effectiveness remains unclear. Objective(s): This review aimed to summarize the effect of mHealth interventions on improving the uptake of ANC visits, skilled birth attendance at the time of delivery, and facility delivery among pregnant women in LMICs. Method(s): We conducted a comprehensive search on 9 electronic databases and other resources from inception to October 2020. We included individual randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for improving perinatal health care utilization among healthy pregnant women in LMICs. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis and estimated the pooled effect size by using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. In addition, 2 reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Result(s): A total of 9 studies (10 articles) that randomized 10,348 pregnant women (n=6254, 60.44% in the intervention group; n=4094, 39.56% in the control group) were included in this synthesis. The pooled estimates showed a positive effect of mHealth interventions on improving 4 or more ANC visit utilizations among pregnant women in LMICs, irrespective of the direction of interventions (1-way communications: RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.76-2.60, I2=36%, 2 studies, moderate certainty; 2-way communications: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27, I2=59%, 3 studies, low certainty). Only 2-way mHealth interventions were effective in improving the use of skilled birth attendance during delivery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.33, I2=0%, 2 studies, moderate certainty), but the effects were unclear for 1-way mHealth interventions (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.10, I2=73%, 3 studies, very low certainty) when compared with standard care. For facility delivery, the interventions were effective in settings where fewer pregnant women used facility delivery (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.30-2.19, I2=36%, 2 studies, moderate certainty); however, the effects were unclear in settings where most pregnant women already used facility delivery (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.04, I2=0%, 1 study, low certainty). Conclusion(s): mHealth interventions may contribute to improving ANC and skilled delivery care utilization among pregnant women in LMICs. However, more studies are required to improve their reproducibility and efficiency or strengthen the evidence of different forms of mHealth interventions because of the considerable heterogeneity observed in the meta-analyses.Copyright © Md Obaidur Rahman, Noyuri Yamaji, Yasuko Nagamatsu, Erika Ota.

Abstract
  Background: Computer-assisted treatment may reduce therapist contact and costs and promote client participation. This meta-analysis examined the efficacy and acceptability of an unguided computer-assisted therapy in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) compared with a waiting list or attention placebo. Objective(s): This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and adherence of computer-assisted self-help treatment without human contact in patients with OCD using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. Method(s): Randomized controlled trials with participants primarily diagnosed with OCD by health professionals with clinically significant OCD symptoms as measured with validated scales were included. The interventions included self-help treatment through the internet, computers, and smartphones. We excluded interventions that used human contact. We conducted a search on PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as the reference lists of the included studies. The risk of bias was evaluated using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. We calculated the standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. The primary outcomes were short-term improvement of OCD symptoms measured by validated scales and dropout for any reason. Result(s): We included 11 randomized controlled trials with a total of 983 participants. The results indicated that unguided computer-assisted self-help therapy was significantly more effective than a waiting list or psychological placebo (standard mean difference -0.47, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.22). Unguided computer-assisted self-help therapy had more dropouts for any reason than waiting list or psychological placebo (risk ratio 1.98, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.23). However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the risk of bias and inconsistent results among the included studies. The subgroup analysis showed that exposure response and prevention and an intervention duration of more than 4 weeks strengthen the efficacy without worsening acceptability. Only a few studies have examined the interaction between participants and systems, and no study has used gamification. Most researchers only used text-based interventions, and no study has used a mobile device. The overall risk of bias of the included studies was high and the heterogeneity of results was moderate to considerable. Conclusion(s): Unguided computer-assisted self-help therapy for OCD is effective compared with waiting lists or psychological placebo. An exposure response and prevention component and intervention duration of more than 4 weeks may strengthen the efficacy without worsening the acceptability of the therapy.Copyright © Hissei Imai, Aran Tajika, Hisashi Narita, Naoki Yoshinaga, Kenichi Kimura, Hideki Nakamura, Nozomi Takeshima, Yu Hayasaka, Yusuke Ogawa, Toshi Furukawa

Abstract
  Objective. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods. An electronic search was conducted in eight databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese VIP Database, and Wanfang Database) from inception until December 2019. The risk of bias assessment of the included RCTs was evaluated by Cochrane collaboration's tool. The inclusion criteria were RCTs that investigated the efficacy and safety of CHM in the treatment of KOA, with no restrictions on publication status or language. The exclusion criteria included nonrandomized or quasi-RCTs, no clear KOA diagnostic approach, combined Chinese medicinal herbs with other traditional Chinese medicine treatment modalities, and published using repeated data and missing data. We computed the relative risk (RR) and the standard mean difference (SMD) for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. When heterogeneity was detected or there was significant statistical heterogeneity (P<0.05 or I2>50%), a random-effects model was employed, followed by further subgroup analysis and metaregression estimations to ascertain the origins of heterogeneity. Otherwise, we used a fixed-effects model (P>=0.05 or I2<=50%). The primary outcome measures were visual analog score (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Lysholm score, and Lequesne index. Secondary outcome measures were the total clinical effective rate and adverse events. The meta-analysis was performed using the Stata 14.0 software. Results. A total of 56 RCTs comprising 5350 patients met the inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis showed that application of CHM as adjuvant therapy or monotherapy for KOA can significantly decrease VAS, WOMAC, and the Lequesne index and improve the Lysholm score as well as the total effective rate. In addition, this treatment has fewer adverse effects, suggesting that CHM is generally safe and well tolerated among patients with KOA. Conclusion. Our study offers supportive evidence that CHM, either adjuvant therapy or monotherapy, reduces the VAS, WOMAC, and Lequesne index and improves the Lysholm score and overall effective rate in patients with KOA. Additionally, CHM was well tolerated and safe in KOA patients. We found frequently used CHMs that might contribute to the formulation of a herbal formula that could be considered for further clinical use. However, given the heterogeneity and limited sample size in this study, larger multicenter and high-quality RCTs are needed to validate the benefits of CHM in the treatment of KOA.Copyright © 2022 Zhou Lin et al.

Abstract
  Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the need for identifying and ranking effective interventions. This was addressed in a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for SCD. Method(s): MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating effects on memory, global cognition, and quality of life. Random-effect model NMAs were conducted. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias-2 tool assessed methodological quality. Prospero-Registration: CRD42020180457. Result(s): The systematic review included 56 RCTs. Education programs were most effective for improving memory, second most effective for improving global cognition. Quality of life and adverse events could not be included due to insufficient data. Overall methodological quality of studies was low. Conclusion(s): Education programs were most effective for improving memory and cognition, warranting further research into effective elements of this intervention. There is urgent need to address identified methodological shortcomings in SCD intervention research.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract
  Background: Telehealth approaches are increasingly being used to support patients with advanced diseases, including cancer. Evidence suggests that telehealth is acceptable to most patients; however, the extent of and factors influencing patient engagement remain unclear. Objective(s): The aim of this review is to characterize the extent of engagement with telehealth interventions in patients with advanced, incurable cancer reported in the international literature. Method(s): This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and is reported in line with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search of databases was undertaken for telehealth interventions (communication between a patient with advanced cancer and their health professional via telehealth technologies), including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science, from the inception of each electronic database up until December 31, 2020. A narrative synthesis was conducted to outline the design, population, and context of the studies. A conceptual framework of digital engagement comprising quantitative behavioral measures (frequency, amount, duration, and depth of use) framed the analysis of engagement with telehealth approaches. Frequency data were transformed to a percentage (actual patient engagement as a proportion of intended engagement), and the interventions were characterized by intensity (high, medium, and low intended engagement) and mode of delivery for standardized comparisons across studies. Result(s): Of the 19,676 identified papers, 40 (0.2%) papers covering 39 different studies were eligible for inclusion, dominated by US studies (22/39, 56%), with most being research studies (26/39, 67%). The most commonly reported measure of engagement was frequency (36/39, 92%), with substantial heterogeneity in the way in which it was measured. A standardized percentage of actual patient engagement was derived from 17 studies (17/39, 44%; n=1255), ranging from 51% to 100% with a weighted average of 75.4% (SD 15.8%). A directly proportional relationship was found between intervention intensity and actual patient engagement. Higher engagement occurred when a tablet, computer, or smartphone app was the mode of delivery. Conclusion(s): Understanding engagement for people with advanced cancer can guide the development of telehealth approaches from their design to monitoring as part of routine care. With increasing telehealth use, the development of meaningful and context- and condition-appropriate measures of telehealth engagement is needed to address the current heterogeneity in reporting while improving the understanding of optimal implementation of telehealth for oncology and palliative care.Copyright © William Goodman, Anne-Marie Bagnall, Laura Ashley, Desiree Azizoddin, Felix Muehlensiepen, David Blum, Michael I Bennett, Matthew Allsop.

Abstract
  Introduction: Many cardiac devices, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and pacemakers (PPM), often involve a remote connection to allow for data transfer and accessibility from the device to the medical clinic. These devices are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and data breach. Areas covered: The FDA, device manufacturers and professional cardiology societies work in conjunction to assess and evaluate potential areas of weakness in medical devices and formulate software update improvements to strengthen patient safety. We undertook a literature review focusing on the history, progression, and improvements in monitoring of cybersecurity vulnerabilities surrounding cardiovascular medical devices. Expert opinion: Cardiac device cybersecurity will continue to evolve and progress as more research is conducted on potential areas of vulnerabilities. The standard procedure as of now is for multiple perspectives from the FDA, professional organizations, device manufacturers, physicians, and patients to review and analyze the effectiveness of cybersecurity safeguards for these devices. We believe this practice will continue as it equally involves all stakeholders in relation to the manufacturing, distribution, and use of these devices. As information technology capabilities expand, safer and secure medical devices and cardiac technology to prevent the threat of hacking will continue to expand and improve.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: There is an increased awareness to identify symptomatic experiences in children undergoing chemotherapy. An Internet-based health technology accessible and friendly for children and parents to report health problems during chemotherapy has been well-developed in developed countries. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive view of relevant research related to the emergence of health applications in pediatric oncology so that it can provide information for design and evaluation in the future. METHOD(S): Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines support this scoping review. To investigate the evidence on the development of Internet-based health technology, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOHOST Medline, IEEEXplore, ProQuest, and Nature databases were searched between 2015 and 2021. RESULT(S): 14 articles met the inclusion criteria with nine Internet-based health technologies. Moreover, four of nine mobile health apps use a theoretical foundation (SPARK for children and family member, Empower Stars!, THRIVE, and Facebook-based "Healthy Teens for Soaam"), three apps apply four stages of development and testing, and all apps have met the category of the degree of attachment of patients to the application. CONCLUSION(S): The effect of Internet-based health technology through a scientific process by paying attention to the underlying theories, user needs, developer passion, application testing, and evaluation methods is the key to success.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) threatens to disrupt global progress towards HIV epidemic control. Opportunities exist to leverage ongoing public health responses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on HIV services, and novel approaches to care provision might help address both epidemics. OBJECTIVE(S): As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, novel approaches to maintain comprehensive HIV prevention service delivery are needed. We describe adaptations that could address potential COVID-19-related service interruptions. METHOD(S): We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases: OVID/Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Embase for studies published between January 1, 2010, and October 26, 2021 for recent technology-based interventions for virtual service delivery. Search terms included "telemedicine, telehealth, mobile health, ehealth, mhealth, telecommunication, social media, mobile device, internet" among others. Of the 6,685 abstracts identified, 1,254 focused on HIV virtual service delivery and of those, 120 were relevant for HIV prevention efforts; 48 were pertaining to PrEP and 19 of these focused on evaluations of interventions for virtual service delivery of PrEP. Of the 16 systematic reviews identified, three were specific to PrEP. All 35 papers were reviewed for outcomes of efficacy, feasibility, and/or acceptability. Limitations included heterogeneity of the studies' methodological approaches and outcomes; thus, a meta-analysis was not conducted. We considered the evidence-based interventions found in our review and developed a virtual service delivery model for HIV prevention interventions. We also considered how this platform could be leveraged for COVID-19 prevention and care. RESULT(S): We summarize 19 studies of virtual service delivery of PrEP and 16 relevant reviews. Examples of technology-based interventions that were effective, feasible, and/or acceptable for PrEP service delivery include: use of SMS, internet, and smartphone applications such as iText (50% [95%CI: 16-71%]) reduction in discontinuation of PrEP) and PrEPmate (OR=2.62. 95%CI:1.24-5.5.4); telehealth and eHealth platforms for virtual visits such as PrEPTECH and IowaTelePrEP; and platforms for training of health care workers such as ECHO. We suggest a virtual service delivery model for PrEP that can be leveraged for COVID-19 using the internet and social media for demand creation, community-based self-testing, telehealth platforms for risk assessment and follow-up, applications for support groups and adherence/appointment reminders, and applications and internet for monitoring. CONCLUSION(S): Innovations in virtual service provision of PrEP occurred before COVID-19 but have new relevance in the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovations we describe might strengthen HIV prevention service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the long-run by engaging traditionally hard-to-reach populations, reducing stigma, and creating a more accessible healthcare platform. These virtual service delivery platforms can mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV services and be leveraged to facilitate COVID-19 pandemic control now and for future responses.

Abstract
  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent and serious disorder among children. Video games have shown potential for aiding in child healthcare. Video games could contribute to the assessment and management of ADHD, but there are no previous reviews on this topic. Here, we systematically review the evidence about video game-based assessment tools and interventions for children diagnosed with ADHD. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO database. We searched four databases-PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and clinicaltrials.gov-to identify original studies exploring either video game-based interventions or video game-based assessment tools in children with ADHD. After initial screening, full text revision and study selection, 22 articles were finally included in the review. Most studies used PC as platform, with a minority using a video console, pad, or 3D device. Video game-based assessment tools were generally effective in discriminating ADHD cases from controls, and in discriminating between ADHD subtypes. Video game-based therapeutic interventions were well accepted and generally effective in improving cognitive areas and decreasing ADHD symptoms. Gamification and cognitive training could be the main mechanisms underlying the usefulness and effectiveness of video game-based assessment tools and interventions. Software optimization and greater collaboration between developers and healthcare professionals are some of the priorities for future research in this area.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  Traditional otoscopy has some limitations, including poor visualization and inadequate time for evaluation in suboptimal environments. Smartphone-enabled otoscopy may improve examination quality and serve as a potential diagnostic tool for middle ear diseases using a telemedicine approach. The main objectives are to compare the correctness of smartphone-enabled otoscopy and traditional otoscopy and to evaluate the diagnostic confidence of the examiner via meta-analysis. From inception through 20 January 2022, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched. Studies comparing smartphone-enabled otoscopy with traditional otoscopy regarding the outcome of interest were eligible. The relative risk (RR) for the rate of correctness in diagnosing ear conditions and the standardized mean difference (SMD) in diagnostic confidence were extracted. Sensitivity analysis and trial sequential analyses (TSAs) were conducted to further examine the pooled results. Study quality was evaluated by using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool 2. Consequently, a total of 1840 examinees were divided into the smartphone-enabled otoscopy group and the traditional otoscopy group. Overall, the pooled result showed that smartphone-enabled otoscopy was associated with higher correctness than traditional otoscopy (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.51; p = 0.01; I2 = 70.0%). Consistently significant associations were also observed in the analysis after excluding the simulation study (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21; p = 0.04; I2 = 0%) and normal ear conditions (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.40; p = 0.04; I2 = 65.0%). For the confidence of examiners using both otoscopy methods, the pooled result was nonsignificant between the smartphone-enabled otoscopy and traditional otoscopy groups (SMD, 0.08; 95% CI,-0.24 to 0.40; p = 0.61; I2 = 16.3%). In conclusion, smartphone-enabled otoscopy was associated with a higher rate of correctness in the detection of middle ear diseases, and in patients with otologic complaints, the use of smartphone-enabled otoscopy may be considered. More large-scale studies should be performed to consolidate the results.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Abstract
  Background and Aim: We aim to evaluate the effect of smartphone education on the bowel preparation quality of patients undergoing colonoscopy by meta-analysis. Method(s): Randomized controlled trials using smartphones to educate patients on bowel preparation for colonoscopy were screened from the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception to August 31, 2021. After extracting the data, Review Manager software was used for meta-analysis. Result(s): A total of 12 randomized controlled trials with 4165 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There were 2060 patients in the smartphone group, including 1784 patients with adequate bowel preparation, with a rate of 86.6%, and 2105 patients in the control group, including 1614 patients with adequate bowel preparation, with a rate of 76.7%, and pooled risk ratio (RR) was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.23, P < 0.01). Eight included studies reported the adenoma detection rate. The adenoma detection rate in the smartphone group was 26.2%, and the rate in the control group was 19.3%, with an RR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.03-1.62, P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Using smartphones to educate patients on bowel preparation for colonoscopy improved the quality of bowel preparation and increased the adenoma detection rate.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Abstract
  Background: Economic evaluations provide evidence on whether or not digital interventions offer value for money, based on their costs and outcomes relative to the costs and outcomes of alternatives. Objective(s): (1) Evaluate and summarise published economic studies about digital interventions across different technologies, therapies, comparators and mental health conditions; (2) synthesise clinical evidence about digital interventions for an exemplar mental health condition; (3) construct an economic model for the same exemplar mental health condition using the previously synthesised clinical evidence; and (4) consult with stakeholders about how they understand and assess the value of digital interventions. Method(s): We completed four work packages: (1) a systematic review and quality assessment of economic studies about digital interventions; (2) a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials on digital interventions for generalised anxiety disorder; (3) an economic model and value-of-information analysis on digital interventions for generalised anxiety disorder; and (4) a series of knowledge exchange face-to-face and digital seminars with stakeholders. Result(s): In work package 1, we reviewed 76 economic evaluations: 11 economic models and 65 within-trial analyses. Although the results of the studies are not directly comparable because they used different methods, the overall picture suggests that digital interventions are likely to be cost-effective, compared with no intervention and non-therapeutic controls, whereas the value of digital interventions compared with face-to-face therapy or printed manuals is unclear. In work package 2, we carried out two network meta-analyses of 20 randomised controlled trials of digital interventions for generalised anxiety disorder with a total of 2350 participants. The results were used to inform our economic model, but when considered on their own they were inconclusive because of the very wide confidence intervals. In work package 3, our decision-analytic model found that digital interventions for generalised anxiety disorder were associated with lower net monetary benefit than medication and face-to-face therapy, but greater net monetary benefit than non-therapeutic controls and no intervention. Value for money was driven by clinical outcomes rather than by intervention costs, and a value-of-information analysis suggested that uncertainty in the treatment effect had the greatest value (12.9B). In work package 4, stakeholders identified several areas of benefits and costs of digital interventions that are important to them, including safety, sustainability and reducing waiting times. Four factors may influence their decisions to use digital interventions, other than costs and outcomes: increasing patient choice, reaching underserved populations, enabling continuous care and accepting the 'inevitability of going digital'. Limitation(s): There was substantial uncertainty around effect estimates of digital interventions compared with alternatives. This uncertainty was driven by the small number of studies informing most comparisons, the small samples in some of these studies and the studies' high risk of bias. Conclusion(s): Digital interventions may offer good value for money as an alternative to 'doing nothing' or 'doing something non-therapeutic' (e.g. monitoring or having a general discussion), but their added value compared with medication, face-to-face therapy and printed manuals is uncertain. Clinical outcomes rather than intervention costs drive 'value for money'. Future work: There is a need to develop digital interventions that are more effective, rather than just cheaper, than their alternatives.

Abstract
  Objective: Many studies have explored the relationship between insecure attachment and mobile phone addiction from different theoretical perspectives; however, the results have been different. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between insecure attachment and mobile phone addiction. Method(s): Studies published before November 2021 were identified through a systematic online search. A total of 22 studies, including 38 independent effect sizes were included from a systematic search of multiple databases, with a total sample size of 11,810 cases. Stata Version 16.0 was used for meta-analysis. Result(s): The meta-analysis based on random-effects model showed that mobile phone addiction was highly positively associated with attachment anxiety (r = 0.395, 95%CI [0.345, 0.442]) and weakly positively correlated with attachment avoidance (r = 0.194, 95%CI [0.137, 0.250]). The relationship between attachment anxiety and mobile phone addiction and that between attachment avoidance and mobile phone addiction were both moderated by mobile phone addiction measures but not moderated by gender and attachment measures. Conclusion(s): There is a positive correlation between mobile phone addiction and insecure attachment. In the future, measures to prevent mobile phone addiction should focus on insecure attachment individuals and help them construct a healthy attachment relationship and secure attachment model.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract
  Background: Digital interventions offer a solution to address the high demand for mental health promotion, especially when facing physical contact restrictions or lacking accessibility. Engagement with digital interventions is critical for their effectiveness; however, retaining users' engagement throughout the intervention is challenging. It remains unclear what strategies facilitate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion. Objective(s): Our aim is to conduct a scoping review to investigate user engagement strategies and methods to evaluate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion in adults. Method(s): This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. The search was conducted in 7 electronic databases from inception to April 2020. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: adult (aged >=18 years) users of digital interventions for mental health promotion from the general population; any digital intervention for mental health promotion; and user engagement strategies described in the intervention design. We extracted the following data items: study characteristics, digital intervention (type and engagement strategy), evaluation of engagement strategy (method and result specifying whether the strategy was effective at facilitating engagement), and features of engagement (extent of use and subjective experience of users). Result(s): A total of 2766 studies were identified, of which 16 (0.58%) met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included randomized controlled trials (6/16, 37%), studies analyzing process data (5/16, 31%), observational studies (3/16, 19%), and qualitative studies (2/16, 13%). The digital interventions for mental health promotion were either web based (12/16, 75%) or mobile app based (4/16, 25%). The engagement strategies included personalized feedback about intervention content or users' mental health status; guidance regarding content and progress through e-coaching; social forums, and interactivity with peers; content gamification; reminders; and flexibility and ease of use. These engagement strategies were deemed effective based on qualitative user feedback or responses on questionnaires or tools (4/16, 25%), usability data (5/16, 31%), or both (7/16, 44%). Most studies identified personalized support in the form of e-coaching, peer support through a social platform, personalized feedback, or joint videoconference sessions as an engaging feature. Conclusion(s): Personalized support during the intervention, access to social support, and personalized feedback seem to promote engagement with digital interventions for mental health promotion. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the included studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes, and typically did not address engagement as the primary outcome. Despite the importance of user engagement for the effectiveness of digital interventions, this field has not yet received much attention. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of different strategies required to facilitate user engagement in digital interventions for mental health promotion.Copyright © Maham Saleem, Lisa Kuhne, Karina Karolina De Santis, Lara Christianson, Tilman Brand, Heide Busse.

Abstract
  Background: Chatbot is a timely topic applied in various fields, including medicine and health care, for human-like knowledge transfer and communication. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been proven particularly applicable in health care, with the ability for complex dialog management and conversational flexibility. Objective(s): This review article aims to report on the recent advances and current trends in chatbot technology in medicine. A brief historical overview, along with the developmental progress and design characteristics, is first introduced. The focus will be on cancer therapy, with in-depth discussions and examples of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, patient support, workflow efficiency, and health promotion. In addition, this paper will explore the limitations and areas of concern, highlighting ethical, moral, security, technical, and regulatory standards and evaluation issues to explain the hesitancy in implementation. Method(s): A search of the literature published in the past 20 years was conducted using the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases. The screening of chatbots was guided by the open-access Botlist directory for health care components and further divided according to the following criteria: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, support, workflow, and health promotion. Result(s): Even after addressing these issues and establishing the safety or efficacy of chatbots, human elements in health care will not be replaceable. Therefore, chatbots have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice by working alongside health practitioners to reduce costs, refine workflow efficiencies, and improve patient outcomes. Other applications in pandemic support, global health, and education are yet to be fully explored. Conclusion(s): Further research and interdisciplinary collaboration could advance this technology to dramatically improve the quality of care for patients, rebalance the workload for clinicians, and revolutionize the practice of medicine.Copyright © Lu Xu, Leslie Sanders, Kay Li, James C L Chow.

Abstract
  Given the growth in the numbers of visually impaired (VI) people in low-income countries, the development of affordable electronic travel aid (ETA) systems employing devices, sensors, and apps embedded in ordinary smartphones becomes a potentially cost-effective and reasonable all-in-one solution of utmost importance for the VI. This paper offers an overview of recent ETA research prototypes that employ smartphones for assisted orientation and navigation in indoor and outdoor spaces by providing additional information about the surrounding objects. Scientific achievements in the field were systematically reviewed using PRISMA methodology. Comparative meta-analysis showed how various smartphone-based ETA prototypes could assist with better orientation, navigation, and wayfinding in indoor and outdoor environments. The analysis found limited interest among researchers in combining haptic interfaces and computer vision capabilities in smartphone-based ETAs for the blind, few attempts to employ novel state-of-the-art computer vision methods based on deep neural networks, and no evaluations of existing off-the-shelf navigation solutions. These results were contrasted with findings from a survey of blind expert users on their problems in navigating in indoor and outdoor environments. This revealed a major mismatch between user needs and academic development in the field.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is the fourth most common chronic disease worldwide. The adoption of preventative measures and effective self-management interventions can help improve bone health. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can play a key role in the care and self-management of patients with osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE(S): This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available mHealth apps targeting osteoporosis self-management, aiming to determine the current status, gaps, and challenges that future research could address, as well as propose appropriate recommendations. METHOD(S): A systematic review of all English articles was conducted, in addition to a survey of all apps available in iOS and Android app stores as of May 2021. A comprehensive literature search (2010 to May 2021) of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was conducted. Articles were included if they described apps dedicated to or useful for osteoporosis (targeting self-management, nutrition, physical activity, and risk assessment) delivered on smartphone devices for adults aged >=18 years. Of the 32 articles, a random effects meta-analysis was performed on 13 (41%) studies of randomized controlled trials, whereas the 19 (59%) remaining studies were only included in the narrative synthesis as they did not provide enough data. RESULT(S): In total, 3906 unique articles were identified. Of these 3906 articles, 32 (0.81%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in depth. The 32 studies comprised 14,235 participants, of whom, on average, 69.5% (n=9893) were female, with a mean age of 49.8 (SD 17.8) years. The app search identified 23 relevant apps for osteoporosis self-management. The meta-analysis revealed that mHealth-supported interventions resulted in a significant reduction in pain (Hedges g -1.09, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.45) and disability (Hedges g -0.77, 95% CI -1.59 to 0.05). The posttreatment effect of the digital intervention was significant for physical function (Hedges g 2.54, 95% CI -4.08 to 4.08) but nonsignificant for well-being (Hedges g 0.17, 95% CI -1.84 to 2.17), physical activity (Hedges g 0.09, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), anxiety (Hedges g -0.29, 95% CI -6.11 to 5.53), fatigue (Hedges g -0.34, 95% CI -5.84 to 5.16), calcium (Hedges g -0.05, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), vitamin D intake (Hedges g 0.10, 95% CI -4.05 to 4.26), and trabecular score (Hedges g 0.06, 95% CI -1.00 to 1.12). CONCLUSION(S): Osteoporosis apps have the potential to support and improve the management of the disease and its symptoms; they also appear to be valuable tools for patients and health professionals. However, most of the apps that are currently available lack clinically validated evidence of their efficacy and focus on a limited number of symptoms. A more holistic and personalized approach within a cocreation design ecosystem is needed.

Abstract
  While the impact of Community Health Workers (CHWs) on home-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care has been documented, barriers and recommendations have not been systematically reviewed. Following the reporting requirements of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we used an aggregative narrative synthesis approach to summarize the results of qualitative studies published between January 1, 2000, and November 6, 2020 in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In total, 17 studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. They reported on a range of roles played by CHWs in HIV care, including education and health promotion; HIV-specific care (HIV testing services; screening for opportunistic infections and acute illness); medication delivery; tracing persons who had defaulted from care; and support (treatment support; referral; home-based care; and psychosocial support). Many different barriers to community-based HIV care were reported and centered on the following themes: Stigma and nondisclosure; inadequate support (lack of resources, inadequate training, inadequate funding, and inadequate monitoring); and health system challenges (patients' preference for more frequent visits and poor integration of CHWs in the wider health care system). Recommendations to mitigate these barriers included: Addressing HIV-related stigma; introducing updated and relevant CHW training; strengthening the supervision of CHWs; coordinating care between the home and facilities; incorporating patient-centered mHealth approaches; and committing to the funding and resources needed for successful community-based care. In summary, CHWs are providing a variety of important community-based HIV services but face challenges with regards to training, resources, and supervision.

Abstract
  Background: Despite the wealth of evidence regarding effective health behavior change techniques using digital interventions to focus on residents of high-income countries, there is limited information of a similar nature for low- and middle-income countries. Objective(s): The aim of this review is to identify and describe the available literature on effective social media-based behavior change interventions within low- and middle-income countries. Method(s): This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the 2009 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, Elsevier, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Global Index Medicus, and the final search was conducted on April 6, 2021. We excluded studies published before 2000 because of the subject matter. We included studies that evaluated interventions conducted at least partly on a social media platform. Result(s): We identified 1832 studies, of which 108 (5.89%) passed title-abstract review and were evaluated by full-text review. In all, 30.6% (33/108) were included in the final analysis. Although 22 studies concluded that the social media intervention was effective, only 13 quantified the level of social media engagement, of which, few used theory (n=8) or a conceptual model (n=5) of behavior change. Conclusion(s): We identified gaps in the settings of interventions, types and sectors of interventions, length of follow-up, evaluation techniques, use of theoretical and conceptual models, and discussions of the privacy implications of social media use.

Abstract
  Background: Telemedicine is increasingly being leveraged, as the need for remote access to health care has been driven by the rising chronic disease incidence and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also important to understand patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for telemedicine and the factors contributing toward it, as this knowledge may inform health policy planning processes, such as resource allocation or the development of a pricing strategy for telemedicine services. Currently, most of the published literature is focused on cost-effectiveness analysis findings, which guide health care financing from the health system's perspective. However, there is limited exploration of the WTP from a patient's perspective, despite it being pertinent to the sustainability of telemedicine interventions. Objective(s): To address this gap in research, this study aims to conduct a systematic review to describe the WTP for telemedicine interventions and to identify the factors influencing WTP among patients with chronic diseases in high-income settings. Method(s): We systematically searched 4 databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and EconLit). A total of 2 authors were involved in the appraisal. Studies were included if they reported the WTP amounts or identified the factors associated with patients' WTP, involved patients aged >=18 years who were diagnosed with chronic diseases, and were from high-income settings. Result(s): A total of 11 studies from 7 countries met this study's inclusion criteria. The proportion of people willing to pay for telemedicine ranged from 19% to 70% across the studies, whereas the values for WTP amounts ranged from US $0.89 to US $821.25. We found a statistically significant correlation of age and distance to a preferred health facility with the WTP for telemedicine. Higher age was associated with a lower WTP, whereas longer travel distance was associated with a higher WTP. Conclusion(s): On the basis of our findings, the following are recommendations that may enhance the WTP: exposure to the telemedicine intervention before assessing the WTP, the lowering of telemedicine costs, and the provision of patient education to raise awareness on telemedicine's benefits and address patients' concerns. In addition, we recommend that future research be directed at standardizing the reporting of WTP studies with the adoption of a common metric for WTP amounts, which may facilitate the generalization of findings and effect estimates.Copyright © Valerie Chua, Jin Hean Koh, Choon Huat Gerald Koh, Shilpa Tyagi.

Abstract
  Background: Alcohol consumption in pregnancy has been associated with serious fetal health risks and maternal complications. While previous systematic reviews of digital interventions during pregnancy have targeted smoking cessation and flu vaccine uptake, few studies have sought to evaluate their effectiveness in preventing alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Objective(s): This systematic review aims to assess (1) whether digital interventions are effective in preventing alcohol consumption during the pregnancy/pregnancy-planning period, and (2) the differential effectiveness of alternative digital intervention platforms (ie, computers, mobiles, and text messaging services). Method(s): PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for studies with digital interventions aiming to prevent alcohol consumption among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. A random effects primary meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the combined effect size and extent to which different digital platforms were successful in preventing alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Result(s): Six studies were identified and included in the final review. The primary meta-analysis produced a sample-weighted odds ratio (OR) of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.91; P=.02) in favor of digital interventions decreasing the risk of alcohol consumption during pregnancy when compared to controls. Computer/internet-based interventions (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.93) were an effective platform for preventing alcohol consumption. Too few studies of text messaging (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.29-2.52) were available to draw a conclusion. Conclusion(s): Overall, our review highlights the potential for digital interventions to prevent alcohol consumption among pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant. Considering the advantages of digital interventions in promoting healthy behavioral changes, future research is necessary to understand how certain platforms may increase user engagement and intervention effectiveness to prevent women from consuming alcohol during their pregnancies.Copyright © Sarah Soyeon Oh, Jong Youn Moon, Doukyoung Chon, Carol Mita, Jourdyn A Lawrence, Eun-Cheol Park, Ichiro Kawachi.

Abstract
  Background: Studies have acknowledged that mindfulness exercise guided by a smartphone app has a positive impact on mental health and physical health. However, mindfulness guided by a smartphone app on mental health is still in its infancy stage. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of mindfulness intervention guided by a smartphone app on negative emotions and stress in a non-clinical population with emotional symptoms. Method(s): We searched major databases, namely, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang, to identify all of the relevant studies published in English or Chinese from their inception until November 9, 2021. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with Cochrane risk-of-bias bias assessment tool. Two researchers independently conducted document retrieval, study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality evaluation. Result(s): A total of eight studies were included in the study, with 574 subjects (experimental group: 348; control group: 226). A random effects model was selected to combine effect sizes. The results of the meta-analysis showed that mindfulness exercise guided by a smartphone app reduced negative emotions [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.232, 95% CI: -0.398 to -0.066, p = 0.006], depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.367, 95% CI: -0.596 to -0.137, p = 0.002), and anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.490, 95% CI: -0.908 to -0.071, p = 0.022). Conclusion(s): The findings indicate the potentially beneficial effect of mindfulness exercise guided by a smartphone app on symptoms of depression and anxiety among individuals in a non-clinical population with emotional symptoms. Considering the small number and overall methodological weakness of the included studies and lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the results should be interpreted with caution, and future rigorously designed RCTs are warranted to provide more reliable evidence.Copyright © 2022 Wu, Ma, Zuo, Zheng, Zhou, Qin and Ren.

Abstract
  Background: The vast majority (90%) of the world's adolescents aged 10-19 live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and in those resource-limited settings, girls face distinct challenges across multiple health, social, and economic domains. Gender equality and girls' empowerment are key goals in their own right and are central to all other development goals. Digital literacy is a great enabler for the empowerment of young girls. This systematic review aims to assess the range and nature of digital literacy interventions implemented to empower adolescent girls in LMICs and identify evidence about adolescent girls' access and use of digital technologies in LMICs. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review of studies following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) standards for systematic reviews. Two reviewers selected studies, conducted quality assessments, and extracted data by using standard forms. The collected data include the design of the study, type of digital literacy intervention, target audience, intervention received, intervention reach, data analysis, and study outcomes. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020216756). Result(s): Thirty-five studies met the eligibility for inclusion and of those, 11 were experimental studies (randomized controlled trial = 6; quasi-experimental = 2; before-after with no control = 3), 11 were cross-sectional/descriptive studies, seven studies used a mixed-method approach, and six were qualitative studies on digital literacy interventions to empower young girls in LMICs. The majority of digital literacy interventions were designed and implemented to improve sexual and reproductive health rights and decision-making of adolescent girls in LMICs (n = 33). Only three papers reported the use of digital media for health-related information and decision making, while only one reported on educational and social empowerment. Discussion(s): Our findings suggest that digital literacy interventions such as mobile phones, mobile health tools, media exposure, access to the internet, internet-based educational strategies, social media exposure are effective to empower adolescent girls to access health services and information and also enhance the access to educational resources. However, we found inconclusive evidence on the effectiveness of digital literacy to enhance girls' access to financial services and economic empowerment. More rigorous studies with long-term follow-ups to assess the effectiveness of such interventions to empower adolescent girls in LMICs are urgently needed.Copyright © 2021 Meherali, Rahim, Campbell and Lassi.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Smartphones are used in cervical screening for visual inspection after acetic acid or Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) application to capture and share images to improve the sensitivity and interobserver variability of VIA/VILI. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone images of the cervix at the time of VIA/VILI (termed S-VIA) in the detection of precancerous lesions in women undergoing cervical screening. METHOD(S): This systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2020, were assessed. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and LILACS were searched. Cohort and cross-sectional studies were considered. S-VIA was compared with the reference standard of histopathology. We excluded studies where additional technology was added to the smartphone including artificial intelligence, enhanced visual assessment, and other algorithms to automatically diagnose precancerous lesions. The primary outcome was the accuracy of S-VIA for the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN 2+). Data were extracted, and we plotted the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of S-VIA using forest plots. This study was prospectively registered with The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews:CRD42020204024. RESULT(S): Six thousand three studies were screened, 71 full texts assessed, and eight studies met criteria for inclusion, with six included in the final meta-analysis. The sensitivity of S-VIA for the diagnosis of CIN 2+ was 74.56% (95% CI, 70.16 to 78.95; I2 61.30%), specificity was 61.75% (95% CI, 56.35 to 67.15; I2 95.00%), negative predictive value was 93.71% (95% CI, 92.81 to 94.61; I2 0%), and positive predictive value was 26.97% (95% CI, 24.13 to 29.81; I2 61.3%). CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that S-VIA has accuracy in the detection of CIN 2+ and may provide additional support to health care providers delivering care in low-resource settings.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and test retest reliability of physical activity trackers (accelerometer, multi-sensor, smartphone, pedometer) for estimating energy expenditure during walking in individuals with stroke. DATA SOURCES: Webline, Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Bielefeld Academic Search Engine and Wiley Online Library databases from 1980 to November 2020. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria were studies that examined the validity of portable physical activity trackers for estimating energy expenditure in individuals with stroke during walking activities compared to indirect calorimetry. DATA EXTRACTION: This systematic review was reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the methodological quality of the included studies was determined with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. The study selection was made by two blind observers. DATA SYNTHESIS: We screened 3677 articles, 3647 were excluded after duplicates removing and title and abstracts reviewing. Thirty articles were included for full-text analysis. Eight articles met the inclusion criteria (184 individuals with stroke) and were included in the data synthesis and meta-analysis. For all monitors, activities and placements, the overall level of correlation with indirect calorimetry was 0.34 (CI95% 0.23; 0.44). After subgroups analysis, we showed that type and placement have no effect on the level of validity. Test-retest reliability was high, with Intra Class Correlation equal to 0.89 (CI95% 0.76; 0.95). CONCLUSION(S): Portable physical activity monitors provided a low correlation with indirect calorimetry during walking in individuals with stroke. It seems essential to pursue studies to improve their validity in this population.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  The present meta-analytic review aimed to synthesize the global prevalence characteristics of digital addiction in the general population. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO for studies reporting prevalence of various subtypes of digital addiction published before October 31, 2021. Studies were eligible if they were published in peer-reviewed journals, used a validated tool to assess digital addiction, and passed the qualify assessment. In total, 498 articles with 507 studies were included in systematic review, and the meta-analysis included 495 articles with 504 studies covering 2,123,762 individuals from 64 countries. Global pooled prevalence estimates were 26.99% (95% CI, 22.73-31.73) for smartphone addiction, 17.42% (95% CI, 12.42-23.89) for social media addiction, 14.22% (95% CI, 12.90-15.65) for Internet addiction, 8.23% (95% CI, 5.75-11.66) for cybersex addiction, and 6.04% (95% CI, 4.80-7.57) for game addiction. Higher prevalence of digital addiction was found in Eastern Mediterranean region and low/lower-middle income countries. Males had higher risk for Internet and game addiction. An increasing trend of digital addiction during the past two decades was found, which dramatically worsened during COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides the first and comprehensive estimation for the global prevalence of multiple subtypes of digital addiction, which varied between regions, economic levels, time periods of publication, genders, and assessment scales.

Abstract
  Background: Various methods exist for the induction of labor (IOL), and there is limited consensus as to optimal methods. Off-label misoprostol is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for IOL but preparing it into doses suitable for IOL lacks precision, with potential adverse outcomes if dosing is inaccurate. This study explores potential outcomes and costs associated with increased uptake of a low-dose (25 microg) oral misoprostol formulation (Angusta; Norgine BV, Amsterdam) approved for IOL, in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Method(s): A literature review was undertaken to derive probabilities of delivery outcomes (vaginal, instrumental, and cesarean sections) for IOL methods, from published meta-analyses. Outcomes for oral misoprostol tablets (25 microg) were unavailable in the meta-analyses, so were estimated using data from two published retrospective cohort studies. A model was developed to predict the frequency of IOL outcomes and associated costs at the national level, across multiple scenarios. Scenarios were tested using a moderate, medium, and high increase in oral misoprostol tablet (25 microg) uptake. Market shares, costs, and induction rates were defined for each country using multiple data sources. Result(s): Increased uptake of oral misoprostol tablets (25 microg) was estimated to be associated with a slightly increased rate of routine vaginal deliveries, and concurrent decreases in instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. Since routine vaginal deliveries are less costly than other delivery outcomes, increased uptake of oral misoprostol tablets (25 microg) within the IOL market has the potential to be cost-saving. These trends were predicted using 25 microg oral misoprostol tablet outcomes informed by both retrospective studies. Conclusion(s): Preliminary outcomes suggest that oral misoprostol tablets at 25 microg per dose may improve outcomes in IOL and be cost-saving. Further study is required to validate these findings and assess the comparative efficacy of IOL methods, including oral misoprostol tablets (25 microg).Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract
  Background To establish the evidence related to the efficacy of mobile phone technology for managing side effects of chemotherapy and improved quality of life among patients with cancer. Methods Articles published in peer-reviewed journals were included in this review. Randomized control trials (RCTs) and non-randomized control trials (non-RCTs) consisting of mobile-based interventions (mobile application, smart phone App-based interventions or guidelines to manage side-effects of chemotherapy or mobile health services), and adult cancer patients (aged 18 or above years) as participants who were undergoing chemotherapy and received mobile phone-based interventions as an interventional group versus control/comparator group who were getting routine or usual care were included in this systematic review. Databases such as Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane library, PubMed, and Google Scholar were systematically searched between 2007 and 2020. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, the methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by two independent authors. Results We included 10 trials, involving 1467 cancer patients and the number of participants ranged from 50 to 457. All trials measured the side effects of chemotherapy as the main outcome and three trials measured the quality of life as the main outcome. Ten trials included for narrative synthesis showed a significant decrease in chemotherapy side effects and considerable improvement in the quality of life in the interventional group than in the comparison group. Meta-Analysis of four RCTs containing 803 subjects concluded a significant improvement (p < 0.0001) in the quality of life. A significant improvement in the quality of life was revealed by random effects model (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.17,-0.46) and a significant difference (Z = 4.37, p < 0.001) was identified between experimental and control groups. Conclusion Current review strengthens the evidence that utilizing mobile-phone based technology has favorable effects on improving the quality of life by minimizing side-effects associated with chemotherapy among cancer patients.Copyright © 2021.

Abstract
  Objectives: Over the past decade, the idea has been promoted that intelligent assistive technology (IAT) can empower people with dementia. As a new area of inquiry, however, the concept of empowerment and the impact of IAT in this context are still unclear. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to examine the conceptualizing and measuring of empowerment, as well as to understand the impact of IAT on empowering people with dementia in the existing studies. Design(s): A scoping review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, using the following databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Science Direct. In addition, a manual search was also conducted in Google Scholar to identify further articles. Result(s): A total of 28 articles examining the empowerment of people with dementia via IAT met the inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional (43%) or interventional/experimental design (39%). A little more than half (54%) were qualitative studies. We observed inconsistencies in the conceptualization and measurement of the concept of empowerment in the included studies; as such, the exact role of IAT in this context remains somewhat unclear. However, most of the studies suggest that IAT can empower people with mild/moderate dementia by enhancing their capacity to live more independently with privacy for a longer period of time. Conclusion(s): Future research should focus on developing a clear definition of the concept of empowerment, as well as developing a reliable and valid tool for measuring it.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Background: Telemedicine plays an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of telemedicine in managing IBD are unclear. Objective(s): This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the impact of telemedicine with that of standard care on the management of IBD. Method(s): We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on April 22, 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing telemedicine with standard care in patients with IBD were included, while conference abstracts, letters, reviews, laboratory studies, and case reports were excluded. The IBD-specific quality of life (QoL), disease activity, and remission rate in patients with IBD were assessed as primary outcomes, and the number of in-person clinic visits per patient, patient satisfaction, psychological outcome, and medication adherence were assessed as secondary outcomes. Review Manage 5.3 and Stata 15.1 were used for data analysis. Result(s): A total of 17 randomized controlled trials (2571 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. The telemedicine group had higher IBD-specific QoL than the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.34; P.03). The number of clinic visits per patient in the telemedicine group was significantly lower than that in the standard care group (standard mean difference -0.71, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.36; P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed that adolescents in the telemedicine group had significantly higher IBD-specific QoL than those in the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.42, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; I2=0; P.002), but there was no significant difference between adults in the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in disease activity, remission rate, patient satisfaction, depression, self-efficacy, generic QoL, and medication adherence outcomes between the telemedicine and standard care groups. Conclusion(s): Telemedicine intervention showed a promising role in improving IBD-specific QoL among adolescents and decreased the number of clinic visits among patients with IBD. Further research is warranted to identify the group of patients with IBD who would most benefit from telemedicine.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

  Background This study reviews the evidence on ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) for managing and preventing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Methods This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Its protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. We conducted a systematic literature search of five databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane library. The most recent search date was 10 September 2021. Results After screening and full-text review, 27 studies were included, totaling 19 different interventions. Many of the available interventions have not yet been clinically tested. Those that have undergone effectiveness evaluation (10 interventions) showed good rates of effectiveness and feasibility, with some exceptions. The most widely used intervention model is the safety plan, which allows the user to implement coping and distracting strategies in case of suicidal ideation. Conclusions Ecological momentary interventions provide certain advantages, such as their wide availability, versatility, and potential for customization. These interventions can be useful complements to traditional care, especially in situations in which face-to-face care is not possible. Evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions is still scarce. Furthermore, barriers limiting implementation in clinical practice remain. The constant advance of technology means that these interventions have great potential for improvement in the coming years.Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Abstract
  Background The growing access to mobile phones in Africa has led to an increase in mobile health interventions, including an increasing number of two-way text message interventions. However, their effect on healthcare outcomes in an African context is uncertain. This systematic review aims to landscape randomized trials involving two-way text message interventions and estimate their effect on healthcare outcomes. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Global Health Library (up to 12 August 2021) and trial registries (up to 24 April 2020). Published and unpublished trials conducted in Africa comparing two-way text message interventions with standard care and/or one-way text message interventions were included. Trials that reported dichotomous effect estimates on healthcare appointment attendance and/or medicine adherence were assessed for risk of bias and included in meta-analyses. Results of other outcomes were reported descriptively. Results We included 31 trials (28,563 participants) all set in Sub-Saharan Africa with a wide range of clinical conditions. Overall, ten different trials were included in the primary meta-analyses, and two of these had data on both medicine adherence and appointment attendance. An additional two trials were included in sensitivity analyses. Of the 12 included trials, three were judged as overall low risk of bias and nine as overall high risk of bias trials. Two-way text messages did not improve appointment attendance, RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.95-1.12, I2 = 53% (5 trials, 4374 participants) but improved medicine adherence compared to standard care, RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.21, I2 = 8% (6 trials, 2783 participants). Conclusion Two-way text messages seemingly improve medicine adherence but has an uncertain effect on appointment attendance compared to standard care.Copyright © 2022 Odegard et al.

Abstract
  Objectives: Technology unfortunately even though making our life easier, causes a lot of psychological problems when it is not used reasonably. One of them is the inability to live without a smartphone: nomophobia. This meta-analysis study considered nomophobia in Turkey in terms of gender. Method(s): Using "nomophobia", "Nomophobia Scale ", "Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q)", "NMP-Q"and "smartphone" keywords, 9 electronic bibliographic databases from the internet were searched for studies related to the nomophobia scale. The inclusion criteria were determined as studies that the nomophobia questionnaire (NMP-Q) utilized to Turkish people, published in English or Turkish, and reported the questionnaire score by mean/standard deviation according to gender. The mean age and sample size ratio, which were thought to have an effect on heterogeneity, are analyzed by meta-regression. Result(s): From the 9 electronic bibliographic databases, a total of 3370 studies were located, and only 10 meetings the inclusion criteria. It revealed that females are found to be more nomofobic than males according to Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q). The mean age and sample size ratio, which were thought to have an effect on heterogeneity, are analyzed by meta-regression. Conclusion(s): The gender difference was found to be statistically non-significant in 2 of the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis. By enlarging the sample size, which is one of the advantages of meta-analysis, the difference between gender is determined more accurately.©Copyright 2022 by The Association of Health Research & Strategy

Abstract
  Ethnopharmacological relevance: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide with alarming prevalence. Due to its complex pathogeneses and considerable individual heterogeneity in disease, there is no specific medication to NAFLD safely and effectively. Therefore, there is a great need to explore complementary and alternative therapies. Xiaoyao Powder (XYP), a classic Chinese formula, has been tremendously applied to gastrointestinal diseases, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the efficacy and safety of XYP have not been fully assessed. Aim of the study: To assess the effectiveness and safety of XYP for NAFLD. Material(s) and Method(s): The assigned registration number on the PROSPERO platform of this meta-analysis is CRD42020192154, and we strictly followed the protocol. We searched eight primary databases from their inception to June 2020. Two authors independently identified random controlled trials (RCTs) of XYP for NAFLD and evaluated the quality of the retrieved articles by Cochrane accessing risk bias tool. At least one of the following indices was thoroughly documented for outcome measurement: total effective rate, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), body mass index (BMI), and adiponectin. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) for dichotomous data and continuous variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI). R 4.0.5 software was employed for data synthesis. Result(s): Consequently, we identified 12 studies with 1012 participants. XYP, whether individually or combined with essential treatment, ameliorated NAFLD regardless of the course of the disease or curative duration. This benefit was mainly driven by regulating levels of serum markers, involving TC, TG, ALT, AST, GGT, and adiponectin. Three studies where statins were concerned about drug safety reported several adverse events with clinical symptoms, varying from flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea to rash, whereas others did not. Conclusion(s): Our findings provided evidence that XYP is a therapeutic option to treat NAFLD effectively and safely. Notwithstanding, a precise and comprehensive conclusion calls for RCTs on a larger scale with more rigorous designs considering the inferior methodological quality and limited retrieved articles.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Background. Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are a common and prevalent disease with main symptoms of pain, joint sounds, and mandibular movement disorders, which seriously affects the mental health and quality of life of the sufferers. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies utilizing warm needle acupuncture (WNA) for the treatment of TMD, and the quality of the studies has gradually improved. However, evidence from evidence-based medicine is lacking. This study aims to use a systematic review and meta-analysis method to understand the efficacy of WNA for the treatment of TMD. Methods and Analysis. We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of WNA for the treatment of TMD from 9 electronic databases, including 5 English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MEDLINE) and 4 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese VIP Information, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) from their inception to May 2021. The included RCTs compared WNA with acupuncture, electroacupuncture, pharmacological therapy, or other therapies. And outcome indicators such as total effective rate and cure rate were assessed. All analyses were conducted using RevMan software V5.3 and Stata16. Measurement count data used the relative risk (RR) as the efficacy statistic, and each effect size was given its point estimate value and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. The meta-analysis included 10 studies with a total of 670 patients, which included 340 patients in the experimental group and 330 patients in the control group. The data in this review showed that WNA is superior to treatments such as acupuncture alone, acupuncture therapy combined with TDP, drug therapy, and ultrasonic therapy in terms of effective rate (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.35; and P = 0.003) and cure rate (RR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.46 to 2.28; and P < 0.00001) for the treatment of TMD. Conclusions. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides new evidence for the effectiveness of WNA for the treatment of TMD. However, the above conclusions need to be further verified by multicenter prospective studies of larger samples and higher-quality RCTs.

Abstract
  Purpose: Several artificial intelligence (AI) models for the detection and prediction of cardiovascular-related diseases, including arrhythmias, diabetes, and sleep apnea, have been reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify AI models developed for or applicable to wearable and mobile devices for diverse cardiovascular-related diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): The searched databases included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. For AI models for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy was performed to summarize sensitivity and specificity. Result(s): A total of 102 studies were included in the qualitative review. There were AI models for the detection of arrythmia (n=62), followed by sleep apnea (n=11), peripheral vascular diseases (n=6), diabetes mellitus (n=5), hyper/hypotension (n=5), valvular heart disease (n=4), heart failure (n=3), myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest (n=2), and others (n=4). For quantitative analysis of 26 studies reporting AI models for AF detection, meta-analyzed sensitivity was 94.80% and specificity was 96.96%. Deep neural networks showed superior performance [meta-analyzed area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.981] compared to conventional machine learning algorithms (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.961). However, AI models tested with pro-prietary dataset (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.972) or data acquired from wearable devices (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.977) showed inferior performance than those with public dataset (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.986) or data from in-hospital devices (meta-analyzed AUROC of 0.983). Conclusion(s): This review found that AI models for diverse cardiovascular-related diseases are being developed, and that they are gradually developing into a form that is suitable for wearable and mobile devices.Copyright © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2022.

Abstract
  SUMMARY. Migraine and associated nausea/vomiting, necessitate combining antimigraine and antiemetic medications. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the process factors for orodispersible films containing a combination of sumatriptan succinate (antimigraine) and prochlorperazine maleate (antiemetic) using solvent casting method with eight process variables. The films fabricated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and glycerol (TF7 to TF9) exhibited appropriate peelability, TF8 being with excellent peelability, thickness 0.064 +/- 0.013 mm and disintegration time of 38.33 +/- 2.08 s. In TF8 composition, polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 amount was varied as TF8-1 to TF8-6 formulations. TF8-5, containing 50 mg of PVP K30 was 0.084 +/- 0.003 mm thick, transparent showed disintegration time of 17.67 +/- 2.08 s, thus was selected for taste masking. The TF8-5E showed high taste score, i.e., 4.67 +/- 0.52. The study narrowed down the eight factors to only two critical factors, PVA and glycerol.Copyright © 2022, Colegio de Farmaceuticos de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder associated with significant morbidity. Current treatment approaches consist of a mixture of pharmacological and psychological approaches. The emergence of digital technology, and mobile gaming applications, represents a promising novel method in potentially augmenting existing interventions for ADHD. In this review, we will map out the use of mobile gaming applications in the management of ADHD and evaluate the effectiveness of these technologies and any areas for future research. Four electronic databases were searched for relevant articles. All articles were screened for abstract and full text by two independent reviewers, and data extracted onto a common data extraction sheet. The data was narratively synthesized and reported in line with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A total of 19 studies were included. Studies mostly evaluated the effectiveness of games on male children with ADHD. Most games were focused on the treatment of ADHD, while a minority were focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of ADHD. Some of the common gaming mechanisms employed in games included having participants responding to cures, remembering details, and making associations between different entities. The studies generally showed an improvement in performance of children as they played the games, but evidence for the effectiveness of these modalities remains scarce and mixed. While it is exciting that there is such a wide variety of games available currently in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of ADHD, many of the games lack clinical evidence to prove their effectiveness. Furthermore, most studies contain several limitations including small sample size, limited ages of participants, lack of control group, and lack of comprehensive outcomes. To promote the application of these games to clinical practice, robust clinical trials, collaboration between stakeholders and using a comprehensive set of outcome measurements is essential.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Natarajan, Shuy, Rong, Zhang and Vallabhajosyula.

Abstract
  Background: Bailing Capsule (BLC), Jinshuibao (JSB), Huangkui Capsule (HKC), Uremic Clearance Granule (UCG), Tripterygium glycosides (TG), Compound Xueshuantong Capsule (CXC), and Shenyan Kangfu Tablet (SYKFT) as classic Chinese patent medicines (CPMs), have been widely used and shown beneficial effects on the treatment of early diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the comparative efficacy of seven CPMs in the treatment of early DKD remains unknown. Objective(s): To evaluate and compare the efficacy of seven CPMs (BLC, JSB, HKC, UCG, TG, CXC, SYKFT) combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on early DKD by a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Method(s): A comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Clinical Trials.gov, China Biology Medicine, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal, and Wanfang databases from inception to March 14, 2021, for full-text RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of seven CPMs combined with ACEI/ARB on patients with early DKD. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Agreement between reviewers was measured using kappa statistics. Mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) were calculated to evaluate continuous variables and dichotomous, respectively. The random effect modeling NMA was performed and the ranking probability of interventions in various outcomes was also conducted based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Begg's and Egger's tests were used to evaluate publication bias. The certainty of the evidence for outcomes was evaluated according to the GRADE system. Result(s): A total of 62 RCTs with 5362 patients with early DKD were identified. The value of Kappa calculated for the various parameters extracted by the two investigators was 0.821 (P < 0.001). Among these CPMs, UCG + ACEI/ARB showed the best effectiveness for urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) (MD 32.25, 95% CrI 19.11-45.67, low certainty) with SUCRA 92%. JSB + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for 24-h urinary total protein (24-h UTP) (MD 76.92, 95% CrI 53.54-100.58, low certainty) with SUCRA 97%. CXC + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for serum creatinine (SCr) (MD 26.02, 95% CrI 6.10-45.95, low certainty) with SUCRA 96%. HKC + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (MD 1.46, 95% CrI 0.42-2.54, very low certainty) with SUCRA 86%. BLC + ACEI/ARB showed significant differences in triglyceride (TRIG) (MD - 1.17, 95% CrI - 1.93 to - 0.43, low certainty) with SUCRA 90%, total cholesterol (TC) (MD - 1.17, 95% CrI - 1.97 to - 0.39, very low certainty) with SUCRA 90%, and C-reaction protein (CRP) (MD - 0.90, 95% CrI - 1.51 to - 0.32, very low certainty) with SUCRA 76%. Conclusion(s): CPMs + ACEI/ARB might be positive efficacious interventions from which patients with DKD will derive benefit. UCG + ACEI/ARB, JSB + ACEI/ARB, CXC + ACEI/ARB, and HKC + ACEI/ARB might be potentially the preferred intervention for reducing UAER, 24-h UTP, SCr, and BUN levels, respectively. BLC + ACEI/ARB has a better impact on lowing TRIG, TC, and CRP levels in patients with early DKD. However, more high-quality, large-scale, multi-center RCTs and stronger head-to-head trials are required to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: High prevalence of smartphone addiction among medical students may contribute to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. AIM: To estimate the prevalence of smartphone addiction, and explore the influencing factors and related mental health symptoms of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD(S): PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE were searched for relevant literature from the inception to September 10, 2021. Using Stata software 11.0, the meta-analysis of prevalence and the influencing factors of smartphone addiction were determined with 95% confidence intervals. RESULT(S): Nineteen articles, published between 2014 and 2019, were included, producing medical student studies from seven different Asian countries. The included studies were conducted in India (n=11) and Malaysia (n=3), with China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nepal, and Iran each contributing one study. Among a total of 5,497 medical students, the participants included 3,214 females, of whom 2,181 were medical students with smartphone addiction. The prevalence of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students was 41.93% (95% CI [36.24%, 47.72%]). The influencing factors of smartphone addiction among medical students included gender, duration of smartphone use, smartphone function, and marital status. Ten studies (52.63%) explored related mental health symptoms of smartphone addiction among Asian medical students. Smartphone addiction was positively correlated with poor sleep quality (r=.17-.31), stress (r=.30-.40), anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and general health among Asian medical students. CONCLUSION(S): Smartphone addiction is highly prevalent among Asian medical students. Smartphone addiction may adversely affect mental health, resulting in sleep disturbance, stress, anxiety, depression, and neuroticism. It is necessary to take appropriate precautionary actions and interventions to prevent smartphone overuse among medical students.
