# Ovid_Parser_Meta-analysis_Tool
This program is useful in systematic review projects, as it can neatly parse all the informations from a list of references, after the screening from title and abstract has been done, and save them in a excel workbook.
In order to use employ it, you need to download the full list of references from Ovid MEDLINE in "Ovid labeled Citation" format and apply a three dollars symbol ($$$) after the reference number of an article you want to include. 
Convert the file into .txt type, and change its name to match that in line 92 of this program. Finally, execute this program in the same directory of the input file.
